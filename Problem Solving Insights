Solved Porblems: 6

min(arr)                        ---> Gets the smalles number in an array
max(arr)                        ---> Gets the biggest number in an array
sum(arr)                        ---> Gets the sum of all numbers in an array
[start:stop:step]               ---> This is an easier way to slice a string
str(#str).zfill(#)              ---> This is a good way to enable leading zeros in a stringed number
sort()                          ---> Sorts a list (does not return a new value)
"%.6f" % floatNumber            ---> This prints a float number in rounded according to input number. In this case '6'
arr.index('#')                  ---> Returns the position index of the value being search

(1) Most of the problems requires a return but on small occassions you just have to do a print. Take note if the problem requires a print thought at
    this point, I think it has a small chance. Nevertheless, it's good to be attentive still.
(2) If you want to slice a string, you don't need to use or call the slice() method. Simple use indexing. Use this format if you want to slice from a 
    specific index and cover the whole string... '[#: ]
(3) The ...zfill(#) is a good way to put leading zeros in a stringed number.
(4) Sort mutates the list and not returns a new one.
(5) "%.6f" % floatNumber This is for rounding off float numbers
(6) Arr.index('#') returns the position index where the value being search is located
