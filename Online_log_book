* Use an access token for one of my repo: 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 . Took out 'yarn.lock' to enable 'npm' to run instead on mrojecty nextjs
  project. make sure 'npm run build' is updated before deploying to github and then eventually to vercel and Used const myloader to generate an 
  image in a vercel deployment project page. Retrieveing and making jason files for data seems to be the way to go in the form of a dictionary.

September 21, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Can't really stay up late tonight so by 0100H I'm out. It's good that I finally have a glimpse of a 'backmeup' project I have in mind of building. The
  	linux command has a tool that list all the changes made in logs in a certain period of time. 
* In terms of building discbook:
	Framework:	I think I'll have this specifications. I'll be using Nextjs for this one but although the routing capabilities of the
			framework is phenomenal, firebase isn't that much friendly to dynamic pages as I have to get the help of things such as google 
			cloud functions. But, just like react, there are ways to go about this. I can make a single page app but the problem would 
			be when the 'refresh' gets called and there would be chaos. I can use the css property 'display: none' and 'visibility:hidden' 
			for this one. 
	Back-end: 	I'll use firebase for the database and authentication. I'll use google and yahoo mostly for this. In the end, I'll have access
			to a list of user and their emails for what it's worth. I don't think I'll be utilizing the email and password for now. One 
			important thing to note is that as early as now, I'll learn how to use one document for the entire database just like how
			fireship did it in able to not acquire colossal fees.
	Database:	I'll use object oriented programming as i think it does well in keeping my data uniform. The data for authentication is already 
			handles so a user would have this list of data for him: {Devotionals:[],Prayers:{Current:[], Answered:[]}, Events:[], Fasting:[]}.
			Just like in the 'to-do list', the map function for array would be utilized for this. In able for me to make the database the way
			I want it to,I need to have a reference and this means going back to the video fireship posted and coding along the way.
	API: 		I'll utilize a bible api so that whenever it is clicked, a form will appear and after filling up the form, a pop-up will be one
			screen to showcase the chapter being sought for.
	Background:	I think I'll dsplay the navigation at the left side in a vertical position so that a nice background can be seen. Also, in the 
			header I'll display a verse.
	HomePage:	Maybe similar to 'whiteseed.live' so the things I'll be including in the navbar would be: About ( this is a simple site designed
			for anyone to have an online 
	Messaging:	I'll include this one and the ability to see other people's profiles. Maybe I'll use Mongdb as the database for this one.
* In terms of backmeup, I haven't quite decided with this one yet but I think I'll go first with this one as it is a smaller project compared to 
	my christian social media app 'discbook'.

September 20, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Next.js is a beast! It's routing is easy and I like it very well.
* Started learning with PHP. I think it isn't hard to learn since by this point, I now have an intermediate level of understanding and knowledge
	with python and javascript.
* I think I'll try applying for jobs in Singapore.

September 19, 2022 (Monday)

* Donwloaded the 'life360' app which makes up close to what my app would be. This is gonna be a challenge and I think it'll take me weeks before deployment 
  and after that would be marketing. I know of a coworket who is a good at selling but I have yet to decide how I can partner with him. Sir Dongjay...
* Download Android studio for whatever it's worth as per the tutorial video recommended.
* Finally able to run my first flutter app. 'sudo snap install flutter --classic' ... this helped me in a recent issue.
* In the flutter site, there is a template that involves a location app with google and the code is in github so I guess that's beneficial for me. Yay!
* This will come in handy. "https://flutter.github.io/samples"
* I think I should make a blog site of my own where I can just pour out all my thoughts.
* Familiarize myself more with OOP with react. I think this is the tools you would need for react and knowing this, you would be just fine:
	* useState, useEffect, useRef , async function, declarative functions, function expression, '.map' method --> this appears to be pretty useful 
		though I still need to master it and last I think is Object-Oriented Programming.

September 18, 2022 (Sunday)

* Practice my coding skills with javascript and this time utilizing node.js for it which works pretty well compared to opening a browser.
* Javascript seems to be a bit harder to learn than python but this is my take for it. There is a 'micro' and a 'macro;. This is true for functions
	and if statements. The 'continue' has the same function of skipping a specific iteration as well as in python. The forEach is used to iterate
	through the elements of a given array. There are many ways to remove duplicates in a list and that's by filter, set, forEach, Reduce,
	Underscore JS, Array.prototype.unique, 
* The '.includes' si a boolean that iterates through an array looking if a particular element is present. Thus the questions mark (?) followed by two
	actions either for true or false can be used for it.
* The '.map' is the younger brother of 'forEach' the way I see it. 
* Apparently, there are some things called 'no code app builder' which I will be looking through soon enough.
* Found a cool navbar code using only css and html. "&#9776" this string signifies a hamburger menu.

September 17, 2022 (Saturday)

* Prepared for the testgorilla test but still bombed. I think this is the 5th one. Now, It's safe to say that getting into tech normally isn't
	a walk in the park. 
* I need to practice on javascript leetcode more. five problems at a time may beneficial for me practicing the 'rule of 5'.


September 15, 2022 (Thursday)

* One of these days, I'm gonna have to incorporate react with next.js.
* Got my first insights of working with the rules with firebase database. Apparently, you can do a lot with it such as configuring the users and also 
	working with time to include it on your rules. Comments are in my 'trialdb' database. Also, I need to get back one of these days to the way
	fireship reduce pricing cost with the use of database from a video of his I had come across once.
* Noteworthy is that firebase pricing can be unpredictable and can lead to a lot of trouble if i don't master it as soon as I can.
* How Not To Burn Money in the Cloud:		
					(1)	Setup Budget Alerts Globally --> Try to use aws budget actions if applicable or use pub sub
					(2)	Do not create infinite loops in the cloud!!! (3x)
					(3)	Don't configure things to scale when you're just messing around.
					(4)	Think about algorithms
					(5)	Secure your app (like apis, datas, security rules...etc)
					

September 14, 2022 (Wednesday)

* I now have a working reference for signing in with firebase with google authentication using a pop up window. It seems that 'PedroTech' tops the list
	of reliable github repos I can fork in the near future. Also, I read about trusted and untrusted providers so that's nice.
* Still need to look at other auth samples with firebase.
* I shoudl remember to use <iframe> tag if I want to embed some good videos on site.
* Got myself to try Figma for the first time to make a draft of what a social media web app for christian looks like. I think I'll focus on it being a 
	writer-mode kind of site so my main featues would more likely be: 	Devotionals  Log Book	Blog   Prayers   Bible  I'll think of the rest
	for later.
* I see that firebase can also incorporate stripe for payments which is nice.

September 13, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Found these awesome site that 'Programiz.com' which is like an online editor to do some coding although the limitations are yet to be recognized fully.
* I don't know if it's true but they say that 'A leetcode a day keeps unemployment away.'
* Practice my coding skills with python for 30 mins with leetcode. Haven't solved the problem yet since my 30-min set time for it expired. 
* Gonna have to get a certification with Azure through microsoft learn as recommended by sit Franc.
* I'm having trouble with useEffect with firebase authentication as of the moment.
* Made a not so perfect reference for user authentication with firebase. It isn't perfect but it's a start.

September 12, 2022 (Monday)

* Learn more about OOP with react.
* I'm happy right now. I bought a new domain at godaddy.com 'dischub.online' at only P65 for one year. I have yet to decide which tools and frameworks
	I'll use for it. I could go with the usual firebase for the backend or I'll try a different aproach with Django. My most obvious choice would be
	to use React for the frontend or if I'm feeling experimental, I could go learn about Vue and incorporate it in it.
* I 've taken two exams last week and I both failed at them so it means, I still have a long way to go in harnessing my skills as a programmer but one
	thing that's good for me is that I type fast. 53 wpm is my peak when i tried my skill at livechat.com.

September 11, 2022 (Sunday)

* First time sending an application to devjobsremote.com.
* Why didn't I make an online log sooner?
* Well now, this is a bummer! Git deleted my changes. I guess it isn't as reliable as I thought it would be. Before, I push my codes to github, I should 
	really make another copy here in my local laptop. AAArrrggghhhhhhh!!!!!!
* I should use Glassdoor more! The problem with is that it would ask for years of experience so a newbie like me would be at a disadvantage.
* 

September 10, 2022 (Saturday)

* Finished my test evaluation with https://learn.alg.academy/main .
* Conduct a 40-questions test with desygner.com with a max of 65 mins. No python. Only javascript involved. The questions were definitely challenging.
* I think I need to have a new strategy. Onlinejobs.ph is great but I'm gonna try other sites.
* These are the Best Sites for Finding Remote Work Online: Remote-Only Job Boards. I'll give my review for each one soon. Some of these sites are 
	high-end which means that if you don't have a minimum of one experience, it'll be an uphill battle for you.

    FLEXJOBS. ...	   - You need a subscription for these so I probable won't be using this much.
    Arc. ...		   - In the sign-up process, they will ask you about years of experience so it's something to consider if you want to continue.

September 9, 2022 (Friday)

* Devjobsremote - This seems to be a promising site.

September 8, 2022 (Thursday)

* Had my first interview as a python tutor. The exams were fun to be honest. The site was meant for kids so the atmosphere was not something I
  	encounter everyday. Still, it was great. I still have two days to.
* I need to confirm if the average waiting time to deploy using firebase is 10mins. In addition, I made a new 'build' folder when I was having 
	some issues deploying a new version to my site just recently.

September 7, 2022 (Wednesday)

* had a reoccuring problem with react navbar but it's okay now when I set the heigh to a specified value.
* Deployed ann updated version to whiteseed.live.
* Had trouble with deploying new version to whiteseed.live again. I think I'll try Netlify and see what happens.
* Found an insane job offer based on California. $30-$36 per hour for a remote junior developer. That's more than I make in a single day 
	in my current job.
* California seems to offer great salaries for developers. Anyway, I should focus more on applying to company's own website rather than onlinejobs.oh
	or indeed or glassdoor in the most part.
* I just remembered one of the downsides in my parts starting out his tech journey is applying and answering the question of how many years you have
	been into this and that.
* In using the '@media(max-width: 'value' ) in css,.the tags must be in the same css. Inline css isn't therefore recommended.
* Ctrl + shift + A ---> This is useful for commenting out parts in a line

September 6, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Made two appointments. One for Weddesday at 1pm - 1:30pm and another for thursday at 10.30am china standard time which is 11.30am in ph time.
* Well, this is a first. I had an interview a while back but it never pushed through due to schedule conflicts and the company was a startup so
	it's a downside. I think.
* "Once you get one, you could always get more." as Aaron Jack,.programmer youtuber said about interview. Also, he recommends glassdoor..20%
* I was wondering why my changes wouldn't reflect in the localhost server and found out that the problems lies with the import. React seems to have this
  ability to change the import destination or that's what it seems. I need to observe further. On the positive side, I finally able to build the backend
  for the questionnaires. Thank You Lord!.
* Made a decent mobile version for whiteseed.live. Hurrah! Thank You Lord!

September 5, 2022 (Monday)

* Made a collection of my sample websites. https://jmarkzcod8r.github.io/Website-Sample-Collection/
* I'm getting closer to finishing my whiteseed.live quiz app.
* I got an email saying my application moved forward with regards to that python coding instructor part.

September 4, 2022 (Sunday)

* I was finally able to manipulate a todo app to send entries to the database with multiple variables. It seems I am having some brain fogs on what to
	do at the moment but I can do this. 
* Work on my bible quiz app more. This time, I'm glad I am able to go more.

September 2, 2022 (Friday)

* I should use codepen.io more. It's like an online cool editor but the setup is fast and lightweight. I could use it while react is still loading to
  to save some valuable time. Also, the way i use position:sticky is that i make a div with position:absolute and then inside that is another div with 
  'position:sticky'. Recently, I found out that there is another better way to do this by using only one div or container and then with this properties
  "position: -webkit-sticky; position: sticky; top: 0;". In addition, I played around with absolute and relative positions property.

September 1, 2022 (Thursday)

* I should remember that 'models.py' is used to create entries to the database of django while 'admin.py' is for creating users.
* Finally, I have a working reference for django. Still, I haven't used the three. The reference just uses react and django but it's a start.
* I think i finally figured out why there was no POST on the previous reference video i tired to go for and it's because either the models or view.py
	wasn't configured right. Also, i think the router needs some clarifications.
* Okay, if 'pyrebase' serves as the bridge for your Django backend to the Firebase database, then axios makes the connection for your frontend and 
	backend to connect with each other. 
* Continue praticing my skills in front-end by trying out to recreate a navbar from a certain site. (1st) method involves display:block and manipulation
	of the padding property for the parent element and (2nd) the one i would recommend would be to use display:flex and gap along with it. Also,
	using 'justify-items:center' has no problem with flex with a good thing to note about. I'll dig deeper with the mobile view in the near future. 
	At this point, I'm thinking about creating a vlog about my coding journey. AT least, i'm getting more acquianted with what kind of display and 
	property best fits the job. Yeyyyy!!!...
* Well, I think today was a productive one. I finally deployed my first app with a backend on it at my site 'jmwebgo.com'. On the site, anyone can add 
	to the database. The backend is in javascript which is faster than python but more difficult to master but I'm getting there. Also, I noticed
	that my localhost has a tied to the firebase database which is convenient for me as a way to update the database alternatively. I also need to
	take note of the templates or phrases there are and there seems to be a lot of them. One thing I need to consider would be the whiteseed.live's
	response to multiple users when it finally gets live. I need to know more of the ip addresses setting it unique to others in order to avoid
	conflicts when one user is using the questionnaire. I think one way to handle this is through time or ip adresses or perhaps the uses of both.
* I got to admit, I've been a bit lacking in my efforts to apply for jobs. The '5 per day sending of applications' and the 'when in doubt, apply' concept
	isn't something that can be seen in me lately. I feel a bit tired actually right now. I'll do it this way: Apply to 5 jobs per day or spend one 
	hour applying whichever comes first. Lord, please help me land a good job where i can have a good work balance and that I may be able to go 
	attend church on sundays. Well, this really isn't part of coding but it's good to be able to see Mica to day by coincidence. It seems kinda 
	weird but okay...
	
August 31, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Practice my deploying skills with firebase to my site whiteseed.live. This time it went well. I figured I don't need to put a public folder
	in the src directory. Just 'cd ..' your way out into it if you are inside it or have just run 'npm start' and then proceed to the deployment
	process shortly after 'npm run build' and then use the updated build folder to replace the default public folder 'firebase init' will ask 
	you down the line.
* Work more with my navbar references and with css using float. It seems that display:block and float is the way to go.
* A lot can be put into entry today. First, let's start with the interview i was preparing myself into. It never went through. Apparently, I slept 
	through it or did I really? I'm not sure. I found out that the company jamiitech is a startup with few employees or that's what my perception is.
* Started learning about react and django. I haven't integrated with it firebase yet. I think I'm not there yet. Apparently, the video tutorial i was 
	following encountered a delay in my part. As i look in the API in the localhost:8000,.it indicates no 'POST' in there. This is something I need
	to resolve maybe by looking through more sample codes or tutorials. These are just some things I neeed to master; 'useState, useEffect, param,
	cors, axios, rest_framework (this seems to be the basic api framework), onChange among many other things. In the video tutorial, the use of 
	POSTMAN in testing out API can be seen. In my case, I use the thunder client in vscode. I doubt, using the postman will make any difference. I 
	need to since in the localhost:8000,.only the get, options and head are allowed. Also, I think i need to dig deeper with cors. I think the video 
	I just followed recently mentions somethign about 'npm run build' but i'm not sure if it has an impact to my predicament right now.
* Tried hosting a simple html file to 'whiteseed.live' and it worked. Now, it's time to revert it back. Now, in have the option to not use react as
	frontend. It was quite fast. My main problem now is hosting with the back-end involve.
* I'll need to find a way to simplify react bootstrap especially taking out the ReactBootStrap at the beginning of tags.
* Finally found the cullprit for the above predicament. '
* Tried 'notepad coding'. i had 2 errors. (1st) is that for embedded css which is usually placed in the <head></head>, the "... ..." is no longer needed.
	It is only applicable for inline css. (2nd) is that i had a ":" instead of ";" which is a minor inconvenience. On using the float property, the
	element itself must be 'display:block'. The parent element is optional as it can be 'display:block' or don't put at all. The 'margin' comes next
	to what seems to be significant. Note, that using 'display:flex' isn't recommended here at all.


August 30, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Follow-code with a todo app reference.
* Learned more about the properties of hyperlinks and the span tag which have an inline property I can manipulate with.

August 29, 2022 (Moday)

* Gonna try configuring samples here on github. Hosted one for now.
* Continue working on whiteseed.live
* on Django,. make migrations with a dedicated terminal running the server on the background and also, when rendering html files, it must be in 
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">
	<head>
	    <meta charset="UTF-8">
	    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

	<body>
		<....  CONTENTS HERE  .....>
	</body>
	</html>

August 28, 2022 (Sunday)

* Made an account with Figma for my deisgns in the future and current.

August 27, 2022 (Saturday)

* Finally got a working button for my django simple app. Also, I've been learning quite progressively with it.
* FIREBASE DEPLOY! I was wondering why my code didn't push through despote I'm done with 'firebase init'. It was quite silly of me.
* When configuring with the html files on the templates, i think it is best to modify the 'urls.py' next and then the 'views.py'.
* So far, my django references includes rendering html files. It may be good to have a counter, i think.

August 26,2022 (Friday)

* Consumed another 30 minutes of the Front-end interview video.
* Clone a django repository at github. Also, I'm having trouble opening my previous folder in django. I should practice putting the word 'main' in the 
	django folder with the settings.py in it for more clarity.

ugust 25, 2022 (Thursday)

* Made a scheduled appointment for a video conference on August 31, 2022. 6:30am - 7:00am. Wish me luck.
* Prepare some interview technicalities for front end web development. Spent about 30 mins. with this video 
	"Frontend Interview Questions 2021 | Front End Developer Interview Questions And Answers |Simplilearn"
* Having trouble with react navbar. Their documentaion is questionable. React bootstrap feels like i want it to give the boots sometimes. 
	Found out that 	upgrading my react dom and bootstrap can lead to unwanted consequences.
* Worked on whiteseed.live on this local laptop. I made some pretty decent gains today. Thank You Lord! But, still I have a long way to go. The back-end
	still needs to be done for it. I'll do it with django. For now, it's time to push some codes to github.
* Update my git commands knowledge.
* Pushed whiteseed.live codes

August 23, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Did a video survey as emailed from onlinejobs.ph

August 22, 2022 (Monday)

* Continue to work on online portfolio.
* Found one solution for whitescreen react error.. <Router basename='/index.html'>

August 20, 2022 (Saturday)

* Make some notes about django.
* This install django in a virtual environment
	'pipenv install django'

This opens a file in vscode
	'code .'

This activates the virtual environment
	'pipenv shell'

This creates files in the current directory
'django-admin startproject storefront .'

This sets up our server. Try opening new terminal and type above if you are in trouble running server.
'python3 manage.py runserver'

Go to storefront directory and type. Note: everytime you make an app add it to settings.py INSTALLED_APPS list at the bottom. For this case, add in 'playground' with a comma at last.
'python manage.py startapp playground'

These sets "Hello World"
Go to playground and views.py and add

'from django.http import HttpResponse

def say_hello(request):
    #Pull data from db
    #transform data
    # return data
    return HttpResponse('Hello World')

Go to playground and add a new file named 'urls.py'

'from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
	path('hello/', views.say_hello)
]'

Go to storefront and urls.py. Add include function to line 17.
from:
	'from django.urls import path'
to:
	'from django.urls import path, include'
from:
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    ]

to:	
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('playground/',include('playground.urls'))
]

Note always end wit '/' forward slash on urls.

This gives an error to your homepages django. To counter this, remove 'include' as well as path.
	
=----------------------------------------
Html templates examples:

Go to playground, add new folder named 'templates' and add an html file. In this case, let's name it hello.html. with a content of
'<h1> Hello World </h1>'

Go to views.py and configure. The render function is use in this case and not the HttpResponse. 

'def say_hello(request):
    return render (request, 'hello.html')'
    
This is to use as new function.

For dictionary, use:

'{% if name    %}
<h1>Hello {{name}}</h1>
{% else    %}
<h1>Hello World</h1>
{%  endif   %}'

and

      'return render (request, 'hello.html', {'name':'Jmark'})'

August 19, 2022 (Thursday)

* Geez, where to start?
* Upwork - Collected some sample work entry level which is mostly mobile app development.
* Youtube - subscribe to Bro code and got an initial insight learning Java though at this point, my javascript skill is not that reliable still.
* Youtube - Watch some videos with Fireship on Flamethrower.js and about SEO (rule 1 and 2: create good contents, rule 3: render html that can 
  be utilize by bots: rule 4: Go fast).
* Uvocorp - Found a work worth $160 with a 14hours deadline. As much as I want to take it up, my java skills aren't really up to the task.
* Familiarize myself more with XAMPP.
* Add some codepen and html samples.
* Install html end tag label extension for vscode.
* Gotta learn Next.js framework. Been hearing it a lot from fireship.
* Instruction for git: react example
          Go to src directory and not outside and then push to github to avoid errors.
	  
                      git init
                      git remote add origin https://github.com/Jmarkzcod8r/Whiteseed.com.git
		      git remote set-url origin https://git-repo/new-repository.git		---> This changes the target repo
                      git commit -m "first commit"
		      git branch				---> Check which branch you are in and also available ones
		      git branch "new_branch"			---> Make new branch
		      git switch "branch-you-want-to-switch-to"	---> switch to specific branch
                      git checkout 				---> Younger brother of git branch
                      git push -u origin Main
		      git push --set-upstream origin "name-of-brach-you-want-to-push-your-codes-to"
            			Also, use firebase use --add
	    
* Got my 2nd website but this time with namecheap.com. I was finally able to costumize or in other terms push my react app in there. Whiteseed.live is 
  now live. Just like before, i tried manipulating by changing the name of the build folder into public folder but this time, I took some extra steps.
  The directory is pointed to src and the way to do it this apparently was to take out the firebase files in there and type 'npm run build'. The build
  folder will be created without influence from firebase. Now, put the firebase files back and also the build folder on which you will have to rename
  to 'build'. Once that is finish, you may now type 'firebase deploy'.
* Started learning about cloudflare and SSl. Firebase based on fireship provides free ssl. need to learn more about this more.
* Started learning about back-end with firebase. There are two types of databases with firebase accordingly, realtime and firestore. Firestore seemed to
  be the better one.
* My namecheap website isn't that secure compared to the one i bought with godaddy.com.
* Update: www.whiteseed.live is now secured but I have to learn more about web security with firebase.
* Silly me! I though my multipage app for my online portfolio didn't went through. They are at the bottom.

August 17, 2022 (Wednesday)

* After a thousand years, I finally was able to install and open wordpress and this time using xampp. It's quite basic comparet to actual coding with 
  html and css.
* Send my first proposal at Upwork. I need to gather more samples of work and prices in there just the way I am doing with Uvocorp. I think i sent in
* three proposals.

August 15, 2022 (Monday)

* Finished my second order with uvocorp. I think the task needs to be higher than the set pay but then again, I am just starting out.
* Convert red bubble uploader script to exe but won't upload images. Need to debug some more.
* Install auto-py-to-exe but output still won't load images.

August 14, 2022 (Sunday)

* Got a working LMC script for the assignment at uvocorp.

August 12, 2022 (Friday)

* Continue working on second order with Little man computer

August 08, 2022 (Monday)

* Troubleshoot code to run with my first costumer. He uses windows and pyCharm. I recommended using vscode and switching to linux.
* clone a github repo to cnvert python to c++ . Still haven't got it working yet.
* Continue working in my second order with boolean and little man computing.
* Took the test from those guys from Onlinejobs.ph. At least, I think I fared better than my last coding test. The test has something to do with object 
  oriented programming which is something I haven't fully mastered yet and also the sql lite was something I bombed at. Oh boy!

August 07, 2022 (Sunday)

* Took up another order from uvocorp. so far, so good.
* Just like before, using firebase to deploy my new app into my webpage is troublesome but I found that the best way to never overwrite the public folder
  or create a new one. This goes the same for index.html. It is best to run 'npm run build' and once you have your 'build' folder, change its name to
  'public'. Check also the index.html file if it is the one you want.
* Apparently, here us is the way I see it, I should  make a new branch whenever I would deploy my code to a website because it might be harder to edit
  the code after that.

August 06, 2022 (Saturday)

* Using my github static online portfolio seems to be better than using my website.

August 04, 2022 (Thursday)

* Finish my first order at uvocorp. I think it went great.

August 03, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Got my first order at uvocorp for an extra small task. I can do this. Wish me luck.

August 01, 2022 (Monday)

* Looked at uvocorp for some available coding work. It's overwhelming for now. There is such a thing as API, sockets and back-end stuffs going on
  that students need help. It's crazy actually.

July 31, 2022 (Sunday)

* Started to incorporate react-router-dom into my website. It turns out that it is best to create a folder of your routes inside the src file to
  avoid some conflicts along the way.
* Put some codepen outputs on some of my routes in my webpage source code and a particular pen is catchy because even though it doesn't use bootstrap,
  the variables works as a block using the scss description, html {....@supports(display: grid) {display: block;}
* By route sample 03, the javascript element uses a dollar sign '$'. By research, I found out it has something to do with jquery. okay.

July 30, 2022 (Saturday)

* Started learning to incorporate javascript to react.

July 27, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Finally resolve babel error with instructions after 'npm start'. Continue working on react bootstrap for portfolio. 

July 26, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Continue studying react bootstrap
* Git clone one of fireship.io's about discord  dashboard. Manage to be almost there.
* Started learning about tailwind.

July 25, 2022 (Monday)

* Started converting my online portfolio to bootstrap that can cater to a mobile app when viewing. Setting the width to a percentage for an image css
  seems to have done the trick. 

July 24, 2022 (Sunday)

* Spent about 2 hours with react bootstrap configuring a responsive navBar.

July 23, 2022 (Saturday)

* Continue reading documentation about javascript.

July 22. 2022 (Friday)

* Finish answering the python test sent by my potential part time job.
* Last night wasn't really that productive. My time was spent on a site involving relationships. I'll try to be more productive next time.

July 21, 2022 (Thursday)

* Still having a hard time installing mysql with bitnami due to the mariaDB error. It's kinda frustrating at this point. I had to revisit mySQL again 
  since I found an error invovling accessibility bus issue. Also, It's good to confirm that I can check whether mysql is running by just typing 
  "localhost:3306" in the browser and something like that.
* For the first time, I had my first coding test and you guessed it, I BOMBED at it. The pressure given was 30 mins. I knew I could do it if given 
  more time but later found out, there is a more efficient way to dealing with it than what I previously was doing. This would have been the code
  to go. I have known for a while that the "For" loop is good for list but I got to remember that the for-if-conitnue combination is good to set
  hierarchies of conditions. I'll try to remember that in a foor loop, there is like a hidden commented "continue"  Still, I'm grateful.

     def test():
        for x in range (1,101):
            # main condition
            if x%15==0:
                print("Sitehost")
                continue
            # secondary condition
            if x%5==0:
                print("Host")
                continue
            # tertiary condition
            if x%3==0:
                print("Site")
                continue
            # fourth condition
            if x%1==0:
                print(x)
            # continue
    test()


July 20, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Forked 8 repositories about ecommerce. I guess this is the way to for me for now as what Aaron Jack recommended.
* Tried to maneuver my way with one of the forked repositories. It involved new stuffs I have yet to fully familiarize myself with like Turborepo, 
  pnpm, storybook, cherry-pick and nvm. NVM stands for node version manager which is what you use for switching to different versions of nodes you 
  would use. PNPM is performant node package manager which is similar to yarn and npm. I had a bit of headached configuring how to switch versions with 
  pnpm. Also, it's good to put on the name of your package from time to time to read some documentation. The one that finally got me to switch from 
  different versions of pnpm would be "curl -f https://get.pnpm.io/v6.js | node - add --global pnpm@6". From here, it'll be easier to manipulate.
* Install MongoDB on laptop with user "Jmarkzcod8r" as admin. password is similar to 
. Download also the compass versino which serves as GUI but still
  haven't played around with it yet that much.
* Can't believe I didn't include about my bitnami wordpress installation that much last time. Apparently, I installed it for the third time. Was able to open it thru
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/ though I know there will be a lot to this in the future. After reading the documentation, clicking 'manager-linux-x64.run' is the
  way to go.

July 17, 2022 (Sunday)

* Revisited MySQL database. Gain more familiarity with the system because installing wordpress seems to require it.
* This is a mini documentation for mySQL:
    'mysql -u root -p' => access mysql at the root level. Change the 'root' for the username you want to use as you see fit.
    'mysql -u root -p <Data.Table> =>Logs into your mysql at the root level and selecting instantly the name of the table for immediate use. 
     mysql> USE menagerie => initializing the USE statement and then the name of the table by chich we are going to use or modify.
    'CREATE USER 'sammy'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';' => This creates a new username by the name of sammy with a password of 'password'.
    'GRANT PRIVILEGE ON database.table TO 'username'@'host';' => Grants privileges to a certain user. Change Privilege to either CREATE, ALTER, and DROP               databases, tables, and users, as well as the power to INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE data from any table on the server. It also grants the user               the ability to query data with SELECT, create foreign keys with the REFERENCES keyword, and perform FLUSH operations with the RELOAD.
    'GRANT CREATE, ALTER, DROP, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, REFERENCES, RELOAD on *.* TO 'sammy'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;' => Example
    'GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'sammy'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;' => Grants all privileges to user on all tables
    For more reference: Use https://do.co/3OiSNah
* Finally made a reference code for responsive navbar with react and bootstrap. In retrospect, I downloaded a zip file from github on it.

July 15, 2022 (Friday)

* Finally able to deploy my second attempt for a react app. Here is the order to remember: "sudo npm install -g firebase-tools","npm run build",
  "firebase init" (select hosting with optional update to github),"firebase deploy". Before this, I tried changing the package.json which didn't really
  helped much. Oh boy! If you find yourself not having an output, try deleting the build folder and running "npm run build" again to sort of restart
  your system.
* Finally able to deploy my online portfolio in my webpage "jmwebgo.com". At this point, I still have no idea why my initial build didn't go through.
  I'll save the figuring out to some other days. I copied the src file and pasted it to the directory that works and it went through in there.
  THANK YOU LORD!
* Started learning about react router to cater multiple pages for my react app. Followed some tutorial at youtube but when I tried it, it didn't go
  accordingly. Found out the code was outdated. I read the documentation for the new version and it worked. Still needs to explore more with the 
  router though.

July 14, 2022 (Thursday)

* Finally able to deploy a basic react app to my site using firebase. It was the primitive one with the spinning logo. 
* Practice some python challenges.
* Waiting for my online portfolio to be deployed if ever it is truly the case using firebase.
* Watch Fireship video on how he would make a website:
  Frontend: Javascript, ios, android, flutter                   Framework:  Typescript (catch bugs earlier), React (Most popular), React Native (Mobile)
  API: Stripe (payment), Apollo, GraphQL, (For complex APIs)                            Petite-vue, ionic
      Auth0 (Authentication), Aws rekognition,                  State Management: Redux, 
  Backend: Nodejs with NestJS, python (Flask, Django),          CSS Framework: Tailwinds, Sass, PostCSS, Bootstrap
            Firebase
  Database: mongodb, mySQL, noSQL                               Module Bundler: Webpack
            mySQL (gold standard)                               Web server: nginx, docker, terraform, 
            Redis (2nd database)                                Version Control: Github
  Note: Use script tags for APIs, Consider Bun for frontend.
* Revisit how to deploy react to github and push codes there. 
   1. Make a git repository thru the site github. Take note of the name.
   2. Add these to package.json... 
   
   "homepage": "https://Jmarkzcod8r.github.io/<Name_of_repository>", 
   "name": "<Name_of_repository>",
      
      "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "predeploy:": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    
   3. Use:  'npm install gh-pages' , 'git init', 'git add .', 'git add origin "https://Jmarkzcod8r.github.io/<Name_of_repository>", 
             'npm run build', 'npm run deploy', 'git push origin master'
July 13, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Continue familiarizing myself with firebase. I'm here in CBTL here in SM Gensan which is nice. The coffee is good as always. Cafe Mocha has been my 
  go-to cofee of choice for a while now. 
* Use basic_06_titleforme folder in react as test project in deploying a react app to my website using firebase. So, you may find yourself in a predicament
  due to this. Something to take note of in the future. I'm thinking of creating an app that will help commuters pair up when going to a particular 
  destination here in Gensan. I'll have to learn flutter and how to deploy your app in google play as well as make it available for different ios like
  android, apple and the likes. Still haven't decided yet.

July 12, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Watched a youtube video about godaddy by Craylor Made. He doesn't recommend it at all due to overpricing although the company has some good marketing
  and advertisement. He supports "Namecheap and Porkbun" more. Namecheap is good if you want domain, web and email hosting all in one roof. Porkbun
  delivers great value at some of the cheapest domain names in the industy. By ICANN regulation, you have to wait 60 days before you can transfer your domain
  from one registrar to another. 
* Learned wordpress is an open source tool used mainly by 45% of the websites. 

July 11, 2022 (Monday)

* Purchase a website named jmwebgo.com on godaddy.com. So far, I can see it is meant for basic to intermediate style of web development. It's good for
  easy site-on-the-go kind of stuff and showed it to some of my fellow workmates which made them appreciative.
* These are the stuffs that can be included in a navigation bar: "Home, Blogs, Products, Pricing, About Us, Contact Us, Resources, Promos, Careers, Login, 
  Explore, Tools, Messaging, Events, Review, Support, Demos, Solutions, Industries, Sale, Cart"

July 10, 2022 (Sunday)

* Finally enabled click-to-go-to-element part of my online portfolio by using id="" as the identifier.
* I need more tutorials and experience using git.
* Created a pull request for the new first contribution of new card I made.
* Started learning about how to convert your android tablet to be a second monitor. I think I need a cable for it.
* Thinking of making an app to calculate the distance from one location to another to help commuters on how much they should spend in fare.
* Started to look for software that can help me convert my tablet as a second monitor. So far, it isn't a fruitful one.

July 9, 2022 (Saturday)

* Applied to different job at glassdoor and also am e-mail from Toptal saying they paused my application for now which doesn't seem to be something 
  worth pondering about since I am skeptical of the site.
* Started learning about APIs.
* Started learning about bootstrap.
* Made a sample code for bootstrap.

July 8, 2022 (Friday)

* Write second CRUD reference with Pedro Tech
* Resolved first CRUD reference by opening different terminals for client and server. Run 'npm start' for App.js for client. And, run 'npm run devstart' 
  for server side to trigger operation of mysql.
* Apparently, there are more stuffs to install on the server side than the client one. These are some of them: "axios, body-parser, cors, express, mysql,
  nodemon". These can be seen in the package.json. Use 'npm init' to install package.json and click 'enter' all the way. For client side, use
  'npm install axios' to install axios which serves as the bridge to send and receive things from frontend and backend.
* Change repository of online log book from private to public again.

July 6, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Experimented with different inputs of html.
* Change repository of online log book from public to private
* Emailed GSC water district for inquiry about their web developer position. I'm starting to see some red flags on it. It turns out that it is a 
  position that has been vacant for quite some time now. Maybe the pay isn't that good and for a job order position, I may have have to decline
  on it if their repsonse doesn't suit me. It may not be worth it after all but still I won't have regrets sending that inquiry email.

July 5, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Continue to work on online portfolio by pushing codes to repository.
* Made accounts with glassdoor and onlinejobs.ph and applied for one in glassdorr.

July 4, 2022 (Monday)

* Add connect components to my online portfolio

July 1, 2022 (Friday)

* Finally solve the problem I have with the image attribute by installing Pillow 9.1.0 an older version.
* Added new components to my online portfolio.

June 29, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Added new component to my online portfolio. The qualifications box is now there.
* Finally got to be able to host a simple react site at github. It was a trial and I'm happy it finally showed itself.

June 27, 2022 (Monday)

* Added new components to my portfolio with logo of my languages and framework used.
* Watch a video of how to upload react project to github as well as host your portfolio there.

June 26, 2022 (Sunday)

* Added new features for my ongoing personal portfolio project. I'm using react and codepen to make this one and so far so good. I'm building it one step
  at a time. Or, in a similar phrase, one piece at a time. It's like I'm building a giant puzzle putting the components slowly and steadily. 
* Added an instruction manual to my Red bubble GUI uploader. I've used Tkinter, selenium, pillow and other modules for this one.
* Partial follow-code with Pedro Tech channel on using ReactJS, MySQL, NodeJS
* Install Mysql server on ubuntu 21.04 laptop with the command 'sudo mysql -u root -p' as the login.
* After how many hours I finally got the install mysql-workbench-community in ubuntu 21.04 laptop. Type 'mysql-workbench-community' to execute.
* Revisit auto-py-to-exe folder. Executing user interface can be done by locating run.py and typing 'python run.py' on command line.
* Conduct debugging for Ubuntu 21.04 linux for installing lightdm. Found out it is conflicting with the boot startup. Ended up de-installing.
* Continue mirror coding with Pedro Tech crud tutorial for reference.
