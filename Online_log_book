* I really feel overwhelmed right now. At this point, I'm questioning myself whether I should have taken the Dara game order or not. This is really
	time consuming. I think I need to define some sort of scoring mechanism in the game in regards to the way the pieces move. I was able to upgrade
	the AI to prioritize adjacent-3 but in order for me to implement the alpha-pruning, I need to set something like this: 
	# making an adjacent 3 - 10pts. #blocking an adjacent 8 - 7pts. # deleting any of the loneliest in an adjacent 3 - 6pts. 
	#deleting a non-adjacent 3 - 4pts. # Moving at first following to an adjacent-3 - 2pts. 
	Also, I still have a project with Delsa on her thesis. Okay. 
* At this point, I need to have a more deeper understanding with Minmax. I think I can do that by going with the basic tik tak toe game.
* four parameters for the Minimax: seq -> an action sequence, initially empty	; 	state -> some description of the current world state	;
	goal - > a goal initially null	; problem -> Formulate-Problem (state, goal)
* I'm currently looking at a tic tac toe game implemented with miniMax. It's a simple game but in obviousness, the Dara game is way more complex.
	Up to the third depth, I think you can have up to 350 different outcomes.
* I'm currently looking at 'Darachat.rkt'. This is the function for the minimax. '(define (minimax state player depth)' -> The state has three options
	which are 1,-1 and 0 which is dependent based on the relationship of the tiles. The player has two options: either 'AI' or 'User'. 
	The depth is still a bit alluring for me.
* How to implement minimax:
	(1) Start with maximizing:	(1.1)	 List all possible moves. (1.2) 	

March 9, 2023

* This always happens. When I take on a task in uvocorp, I something forget to put an entry here in github.

March 7, 2023

* I think I would need to start to simulate a random response AI before I go to the real thing. I can do this by giving it a list of available responses
	by which he can randomly pick upon.

March 5, 2023

* The Dara game is challenging indeed.
* Okay, so I've been doing this order, right? This Dara game involving the Minmax algorithm is crazy. I think I chew up more than I can swallow. 
	The time needed to complete the code proves to be more than what I thought. I managed to make a GUI for the game but it is in its
	premature state. In order for me to male the Minmax algorith, I think I need to first go through all list of button objects. I cantake their
	coordinates and put them in a dictionary.
* Update on my Dara-game order. I made a randomize button to put the tiles in place. Now, I need a way to evaluate the board iof how good it is for 
	the current player. First, I need to find the squares that are empty. Second, I need to find the 'X' or 'O' tiles that are near it or can go
	to it. Third, I need to determine how many of those would make up a row or column of three. For this, I need a function that takes up two
	parameters, one is the mover tile and the second is the settler tile so that it would return true if a row or column of three is created and 
	returns false in either of these two conditions. The first being that it leads to a row or column of four and the second being it leads to less
	than three tiles in succession.	This is the maximizing phase. Fourth I would go to minimzing by taking out one of the opponent's tiles. 
	To do this, I need to get all the location of the enemy tiles. Then, I need to evalute their next possible best moves if I take out that 
	particular tile. I think it would be best if we go for the first depth first.

March 3, 2023

* ABout to be finish with one of my orders in uvocorp.
* This is an example how to zip files in linux: zip submit.zip *

March 1, 2023

* These are great youtube channels for studying microcontrollers. They also offer good sources of their codes in the description. Very helpful indeed!
	(1) Study Microcontrollers (2) Embedded Systems - Bolla (3) CirKit3 

Feb. 28, 2023

* I agreed with Delsa's thesis and here is my thought process for it. Firstly, the database I'll be usng will be Mongodb. The framework will be Nextjs.
	I'll use reference folders.
* I started learning about c++ and c as well. c++ seems to be more genuine about the type and size of your variables. There are such things as double,
	long double, char and much more. Also, you need std to write something like 'Hello World'. When I look at the available orders at uvocorp,
	there are a lot of C programming language involved prompting me to learn more about it.
* I also have started with Delsa's project. I made the registerand login page. I will configure the present address and permanent address with a button
	to link them together so that if both are the same, one just needs to tick a box. I figured to use Nextjs for this since I already have a working
	reference for it and to be able to be more dynamic. I think I also need to wrap my form in <form></form> or something similar.
* ChatGPT vs Bing Chat vs Perplexity. I haven't fully explored Bing Chat yet but I am on the wait list. Perplexity holds great potential the way I see it.
* I also need to learn AWS as from one of the videos I watched, it can help me reduce the cost of my site in the long run in production mode.
* Made two additional API credentials for Google Console namely: (1) GMap Sample Project and (2) GDrive JM API (I'll use this one to make a code to
	automatically back up my files from a certain folder here in my laptop.
* I finally managed to display a google map in a website at localhost:3000. I'm happy right now! The goog thing is that I can simply make another google
	account at google, go to its cloud and set up the billing. Then, I can play with the Api more in a better state. I may very well experiment with
	google map on how to make the user experience better. To point up a location, you simply need a longitude and latitude. I can set up nodes on the 
	map as well as the routes to take from one to another. I can make an app just like in one of the orders at uvocorp that involves transportation.
	When the time comes up for the transfo app to go public, how can I market it?

Feb. 27, 2023

* Made some progress with Genshop.biz. I used an old reliable Nextjs folder and added Navbar. I still need to modify to make i responsive thought.
	The next would be the login. Right now, it's all Front-end.
* I kept having this issue in Nextjs - "next/font" requires SWC although Babel is being used due to a custom babel config being present.
	Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/babel-font-loader-conflict. It may proved to be time consuming if I go deeper solving this but 
	thankfully I can copy and paste previous working Nextjs folder and run 'npm install' and proceed from there.
* 
Fix 'no module named next/babel with this.Create file called .babelrc in your root directory and add this code:
{
  "presets": ["next/babel"],
  "plugins": []
}
And in .eslintrc, replace the existing code with:
{
  "extends": ["next/babel","next/core-web-vitals"]
}

* Just finished an order about data analysis on sales based on the last six months of the year. I'm feeling amazing right now. Thank You Lord! I was able
	to attend church. Okay! Getting back to coding. I have an interview tomorrow on FONEAPI. Well, let's just hope for the best.
* code.org hold great potential and I might try to explore it's app maker.
* .ipynb usually related to the use of jupyter notebook which can be opened in the browser. 

Feb. 25, 2023

* Learned more about Php with my current order in uvocorp.

Feb. 24, 2023

* I just finished the 2D game html and now I'm learning Php along the way for my current task.

Feb. 21, 2023

* Got some insights making a 2D game in html, css and javascript.

Feb. 18, 2023

* One of the things one should aim at coding is to save time and I think I need to include github extensively for this searching and trying
	out some github repos as reference.

Feb. 16, 2023

* I completed my assessment and is now waiting for the result. I hope things turn out for the better. Anyway, it was still a worthwhile 
	experience. I learned a lot. I can add socket.io to my new stuff I learned. One thing that's been bothering me was how do I
	show the previous chathistory to new users. I guess I'll have to go to the original Pedro tech code and modify in there. It's getting
	hard for me to keep track of the ideas I want for my next projects so I guess I'll have to use some notes.
* I got my account reactivated at uvocorp. So, I should take note to keep it that way and have at least five orders completed before the 16th 
	of the next month. I'll apply a self-rule to myself to go complete seven.

Feb. 14, 2023

* Happy Valentines Day! ...for what it's worth!

Feb. 11, 2023

* What can I say about the assessment I had recently with FONEAPI? It was insanely tiresome.

Feb. 10, 2023

* I am today years old when I finally was able to integrate youtube to a simple Nextjs. This means that I can have a recently uploaded video to 
	a certain channel embedded to my site as long as I have that youtube chaneel's ID. This is helpful for online church services.

Feb. 09, 2023

* Okay, I am today years old when I knew that I can use a costum domain of mine to hose my Nextjs web app. This is nice. But, I'll definitely have
	to consider the pro version if I am planning to scale up.
* I revisited my amazon web service account and took a look at the dynamo database. I might need to learn it further in the near future. I think
	my next project would involve angular with typescript using aws dynamo database.
* As a developer, it is important for me to be learning progressively and this time I will list of ways on how to do it.
	(1) Build a project - This is the one that works for me. I have built at least five projects now and I may have to create some more.
	(1.5) Commenting - I think this belongs here. This is good to enhance your understanding. Keywords for your comments may include:
		easy, hard, challenging, confusing, interesting, I think, exciting, `I am today years old`, etc
	(2) Disposables - I used this technique in the past where I would get a blank sheet of paper and write in there the stuff I have learned
		and as the name suggest later dispose of it only to recreate it in the near future. I may need to go back to this kind of method.
	(3) Mneumonics - This is a good way for memorization.
	(4) Connect the dots - This is like me practing a rap song where I connect the dots or key variables.
* If ever I get to be hired for a developer job or maybe even any at all, I should remind myself that 3-6 months is the most likely time for me
	to be able to adopt or transition. I need to put some extra effort in this time period to be able to catch up eventually to how the system
	works.

Feb. 08, 2023

* I feel kinda stuck on what to do.

Feb. 05, 2023

* I think the site that best do justice for developers would be upwork. I need to be able to succeed in it and make a good record with 
	many clients satisfied to give me the best chance of making a living out of it.

Feb. 04, 2023

* Tailwind css is amazing. I can easily configure the responsiveness of my nextjs online journal web app.

Feb. 03, 2023

* Revisited my old python code for red bubble uploading automation. Sadly, it doesn't work the way it is supposed to for a bunch of reasons:
	1. The OS I used back then was in windows so the os.path has changed and is now something I need to configure.
	2. Red bubble has utilized cloudflare into their system making basic selenium obsolete but from what I read, I can use undetected chromedriver
		for this. I need to test this out further. So far, it holds great potential. I may need to upgrade chrome to 109 if my initial
		duct tape solution of adding `version_main=108` in line 460 fails in the near future.
	3. I get an error after log in confirmation in line 502 which implies `os.listdir`
* I see this to be a time consuming one. Okay, I finally was able to get my code works. I turned out, I need to input something and click 'enter' as 
	the code will try again that way. I modified the code to make it easier to grasp the instruction. It still needs some human intervention though.
	It's good to know I see some improvements dealing with cloudflare.	
* Bombed...	

Feb. 02, 2023

* I may need a summary sheet for full stack interview.

Feb. 01, 2023

* Continue working on that assessment exercise given on onlinejobs.ph relating to google sheets + react + apexcharts. Also, When adjusting
	environment variables, You may need to restart the whole system.
* Substring is the javascript equivalent of slicing in python.
* Manange to deploy a coding exercise I have been working on in this link: https://jmarkzcod8r.github.io/OnlineJobsPH-Exercise01/
* Made myself a tiktok for developers account. I may want to make a program of my own to schedule some tiktok posts.

Jan. 31, 2023

* WHat is Hashmap? What is o-tme complexity? What is recurrsion? I think I need to know this things. Ways you are evaluated: 
	Coding, Data Structures and Algorithsms, design, Communication and Efficieny. It's how you solve the problem that you are evaluated mostly.

Jan. 30, 2023

* I got an e-mail from onlinejobs.ph telling me to apply on a post with a test on it. I think I'll comply. I wanted to use Vite to generate
	a react app but halfway there, I kept getting an error. If I solve it now, it would be time consuming so for now, I may need to stick
	to the old way.
* I need to familiarize myself more with google API so that I can utilize full well, google sheets, maps, gmail, google drive, analytics, etc.
* This is the first time I've known that you can use useState to store up objects which simplifies my react skills.

Jan. 29, 2023

* I forgot that I should go with 'npm run deploy' to update my online react portfolio.

Jan. 28, 2023

* zip can be use for matrices with enumerate. I should take note of this.
* Took me one hourto solve the alphabet problem again but at least I can see some improvement.
* Continue to make my cheatsheet for python3.
* I should probably use this more ...print (type(value), value)
* Spent almost 53 minutes solving the alphabet challenge using 55 codelines.
* All this time, I've been praciting coding challenges wrong. I only focus on the concept and not my speed. Once I solved the problem, that's it. 
	It's easy to forget about it but the way to go would be to assess yourself and how you can improve the next time you got back 
	to it.
* I also should practive writing the limitations, constrains and considerations of the coding challenge I am solving. The "What ifs" 
	should be assessed thoroughly.
 * I think it would benefit me more if I memorie or familiarize myself with 100 coding problems.
 * I think I need to work on my speed solving coding chalenges.
 
Jan. 26, 2023

* I'm planning on imrpoving my online portfolio.
* I got to learn how to solve using dictionaries.

Jan. 24, 2023

* I'm planning on selling my red bubble uploader code as a service with a $5 monthly subscription and a 5 designs per day upload for users.

Jan. 23, 2023

* I managed to add a hide button to my online journal web app and a commented code to filter the mapped list.

Jan. 20, 2023

* I was finally able to resolve my text to speech web app hosted at pythonanywhere. I change the source code on the download.html 
	and took out the mainapp. It took me a few days to be able to resolve this and right now I'm just happy.

Jan. 17, 2023

*  Improved my nextjs journal web app by adding some code to highlight the currently selected entry on the list.

Jan. 14, 2023

* Been really busy lately.

Jan. 10, 2023

* I think I need to modify my nextjs journal web app to highlight the current selection.

Jan. 4, 2023

* I forgot how cool the test to speech web app is.

Jan. 3, 2023 

* COntinue learning about automation and side hustles.

Jan. 2, 2023

* Opened an account with zapier and started learning about it.
* Getting an access token in facebook graphAPI seems to be encountering a problem.
* I think I now have an idea how to automate my stuffs with zapier. I need a python program that transfers or copies files from one folder of my google
	drive to another. When a new file is detected by zapier it would then trigger to post it on instagram reel.

Dec. 30, 2022

* Managed to upload some photos to instagram using instabot in jpeg format.

Dec. 29, 2022

* Started learning about instabot and how it can automate uploading of posts to instagram.

Dec. 28, 2022

* Installed axiom.ai on chrome and now I need to explore on it more.

Dec. 27, 2022

* Started learning about moviepy library and how it can help me trim my pictory.ai reels.
* Practice some hackerrank problems for thirty minutes though it is really frustrating how the questions are sometimes confusing. One question asked 
	to 'print' and not 'return' so I say wat the heck! though I did find some answers online.
* It's crazy how there are solutions from other people you can see when you simply ask it. I've never thought of this really but if I happen to have 
	copied the code that was given to me during the interview and posted it, I might have been able to get some pretty good answers elsewhere though
	it is very much closed to cheating.
	
Dec. 22, 2022

* Solve some practice coding problems at hackerrank. I think I need to familiarize myself with swapping elements in an array to be able to grasp more
	about permutation.

Dec. 21, 2022

* Sleepy

Dec. 20, 2022

* Today is my birthday so happy birthday to me. I found a way to configure the password for myPhpadmin and that is by first logging in with no password
	and setting a password in there.

Dec. 17, 2022

* It seems that hosting a Django site is more troublesome than nextjs.

Dec. 16, 2022

* Recently, I saw potential of an employer of a web developer job and then they asked me if I know wordpress. I replied not so much and after that I 
	haven't heard from the hiring manager. I guess part of the job is maintenance of existing or legacy websites.
* "You will not be acknowledge for the amount of hours you put into work. You will only be acknowledge for the output that you have for the value 
	you bring to the company and that you continue to bring to the company. At the end of the day, you're just a number to the company."
			- sir Chris Sean

Dec. 15, 2022 

* I finally was able to login once again to wordpress Phpmyadmin by setting the Allowpassword to 'True'. Conventional login is not working and so, I have
	to sort to this alternative for now.
* I'm having this realization that ai is slowly becoming a norm and what man can do, it seems to be able to do better and just like what my mentors at 
	youtube see it, it's pretty scary. exciting but still scary. There are a lot of potentials that ai can do and at this point, I am confident
	it may even help me grow my way to being a millionaire. When it comes to technicals, it can be awesome but using them should come with great
	understanding.

Dec. 14, 2022

* Maybe, I should make a python script that logs in here at my github accout and update this online log book so that my monitor would be filled 
	with green.

Dec. 13, 2022

* Uvocorp 
	I've recently fulfilled my order and it was a challenge.

Dec. 13, 2022

* Uvocorp 
	I've recently fulfilled my order and it was a mix of emotions in my part. It proves to be consuming indeed in the same way as my recent orders.
	At least, I got to learn and experience more about matlab. I am not able to view available orders and i think my account is closing but $60 for 
	an order I think is decent enough.
* I'm planning on making a website that shares christian testimonies from different waks of like on a daily basis. I think I can do that by making two 
	databases. One is for active testimonies which are automatically displayed on the site and the other are for inactive or reserved ones 
	which I think I can make a script with deta to transfer the corresponding object at a given point in time. The second database for inactive
	testimonies doesn't necessarily need to be in the Django admin panel. Other locations could do.
* I think I need to make a marketing strategy for the SEO so that my site would be easily discoverable. I'll have to stand in the shoulder of giants
	for this one. In sharing testimonies, my site and youtube are two of the platforms I have in mind. I'll have to make a new channel for this one.
* https://dribbble.com - This website has some of the most insane, beautiful and crazy UI I've seen. It's good for inspirations.
* This site is promising talent.hubstaff.com.

Dec. 11, 2022

* Can't believe I didn't put some entries on the following days. This happened before on the reason of me being too busy on an order at uvocorp.

Dec. 10, 2022

* Continue with Pyqt5 and matplot

Dec. 09, 2022

* Chatgpt ---> I should like at this more as it holds great promise.
* I should make a python script to update this online log book with deta.

Dec. 08, 2022 (Thursday)

* Currently working on an order at uvocorp.com. This may probable be my last order but I don't care.

Dec. 06, 2022 (Wednesday)

* I'm starting to like Deta though at this point, I have little knowledge about it. I do hope they have good web hosting services.

Dec. 05, 2022 (Monday)

* One of the problems I encounter about making my site responsive is the cards. I found out the using flex is the most convenient way to go but I need it
	to behave like a block so an additional property of height:auto is necessary and justify-content:space around would do the trick.
* Added word counter for text area for log though it isn't perfect, it'll have to do for now. If I want it to be precise,I'll have to set some extra time 
	for it. Maybe in the future.
* Finally finish week 1 at hackerrank.com about one month preparation. Still, got a long way to go.
* I think one of the advantages of Django is its ease of access when it comes to accessing its database which is at the admin page which can also be its 
	weakness unless there is a way to strengthen the admin privileges than just a simple password. I can just go to the admin page and add the data
	I wish and it would appear in my page provided I have already made the necessary setup.
* This is how you add database for Django for my reference:
		python3 manage.py createsuperuser
	Models.py:	---> Add class objects 
		ex. class Member(models.Model):
			name = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=False, null=True,)
		    class Section(models.Model):
			name = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=False, null=True,)
		python3 manage.py makemigrations
		pthon3 manage.py migrate		... These is to migrate the data models to the app
	Admin.py:
		from .models import Member, Section
		
		admin.site.register(Member)
		admin.site.register(Section)
		
	python3 manage.py runserver ---> you can now go to the admin page to see your models database.	

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django ---> This is a good source to learn more about Django.
* With regards to the christian testimonies Django website I'm building right now, I think I have to make two models. One is for the bible stories and the
	other one would be for the testimonies. For the first, a simple name and body would do. For the second, these are the ones I can think of as of 
	the moment, name, testimony-body, picture-link, article-link, source-mp3, heart-count, smile-count, giggle-count, care-count.
* HTML with Django seems to be a bit sensitive. I commented a specific part but it still made an impact and so, I ended up deleting it.
* https://web.deta.sh ---> This may very well be better than pythonanywhere. It holds great promise but I need to verify as I use it further. The good 
	thing is that their schedule automation is free and isn't limited entirely.
* Can't believe when updating my environment variable with deta, the spaces almost cut me off. Okay!
		
Dec. 04, 2022 (Sunday)

* Okay, today is Sunday. I need to get to practice some coding challenges more.

Dec. 03, 2022 (Saturday)

* Started my journey to learning about AWS by making an account and going for the free tier for now.
* Scribe — Documentation, SOPs & Screenshots

Dec. 02, 2022 (Friday)

* I may need to learn about Redis.

Dec. 01, 2022 (Thursday)

* Today is the first day of December and I just started my initial draft fro Faithworkz.
* I need to update my react online portfolio to include the test to speech web app.
* https://o2jzxmvkgzd.typeform.com/to/RuTxeBZj -- This is noteworthy. It is the first time I encountered a hiring process that have a video tutorial.

Nov. 30, 2002 (Wednesday)

* I think I'll continue to work on my website Faithworkz.
* It's good to know that my Django web app makes it easier for me to copy paste articles regarding whether there is an image selected.
* I'll make it a goal to finish the Azure certification.
* Solved an issue with Django on how to open a new tab which return the rendered page with this  <form action="ex_form" target="_blank">

Nov. 29, 2002 (Tuesday)

* This is a good component for loading/waiting of the text to speech.. https://codepen.io/MyXoToD/pen/nqjjNN or this one 
	https://codepen.io/jmarkzcod8r/pen/VwdBbNj ###cat walking### or this https://codepen.io/shreetu-hada/pen/GRpbLxd ###dog walking###
* Manage to modify the TTS code by Nitesh Singh to directly play the text instead of saving it to an mp3 beforehand. A minor error occured when I get an 
	error upon first starting the Django app. Solved it by putting two return statements. The first is for the if-condition and the second is the 
	default if no such condition is met being the request to be a POST.
* It seems that the {% extends 'base.html' %} enables for dynamic html. This is place at the first and topmost of html templates units.
	I could use this for the. I would have to learn about conditioning of block elements that if a certain condition is met, this certain block
	would be the one to take the center stage.

Nov. 28, 2022 (Monday)

* I was too tired to log yesterday. 
* I should have documented my step by step process of deploying to Django.
* I forgot that the way to push folder files to pythonanywhere is to first upload it to github and then use 'git clone...' and then, you can proceed
	from there. Note, to get present working directory use 'pwd' in console.
* This is the settings for Django-new-to-Railway which is the one working fine so far that I can take as a refernce in pythonanywhere

	Source code: 	/home/jmarkzcod8r/Django-new-to-Railway
	Working directory:	/home/jmarkzcod8r/
	WSGI configuration file:	/var/www/jmarkzcod8r_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py

	Virtualenv:	/home/jmarkzcod8r/.virtualenvs/myenv
			project_home = '/home/jmarkzcod8r/Django-new-to-Railway'
			os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'mysite.settings'
			
* Manage to deploy a text-to-speech Django app to pythonanywhere.com by first creating a virtual environment and then pointing out that env at the site.
	The problem is that if I try to generate an mp3 tts, an error occurs.
* Putting some tags in an html makes that part dynamic in Django.
* Okay, this is crazy. Also, I am thankful. Finally, got a working web app text to speech at python anywhere. It turns out, I only needed to adjus the
	save directory. As I found out, some countries aren't available like Australia and Mexico. I haven't looked at others yet. Still, this is good
	progress to me having a website with testimonies with text to speech.
* I don't know what's the deal with spaces but they were the reason I got an error when I put some text in the TTS web app at pythonanywhere. 
* I think I need to have a good timetable. Something, I am fairly familiar when I was the editor in chief at blueprint.
* I think one of the main challenges of being a front-end developer is showcasing how your site can be as responsive as it can be among most dimensions.
	On this one, I think I can get some good insights with HTML5UP samples.
* These are my significant insights of the responsivenes of the first html5up sample (html5up-dimension):
	body {	line-height: 1;	}
	@-ms-viewport {	width: device-width; }
	@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {	html, body {	min-width: 320px;	}	}
	html {   box-sizing: border-box;	}	---> This seems to be popular for css developers
	html {	font-size: 16pt;	} ---> This is the original font size
		@media screen and (max-width: 1680px) {html {font-size: 12pt;}}   ---> By being responsive font-size is reduce as pixels are 
		@media screen and (max-width: 736px) {html {font-size: 11pt;}}
		@media screen and (max-width: 360px) {html {font-size: 10pt;}}
			...width: calc(100% - 1.5rem);	---> This property can prove to be significant
			...flex-wrap: wrap    		---> The way I see it, If you set a container to flex and one of its property as such, the 
								components will behave like an in-line block.
			...flex-grow, flex-shrink and max-width are also noteworthy properties to look into. 
			@media screen and (orientation: portrait) and (max-width: 480px) {#banner .image {max-height: 35vh; } } ....also this one
				coupled with flex-direction of either column or row.
* This may prove to be useful:
	breakpoints({
			xlarge:   [ '1281px',  '1680px' ],
			large:    [ '981px',   '1280px' ],
			medium:   [ '737px',   '980px'  ],
			small:    [ '481px',   '736px'  ],
			xsmall:   [ '361px',   '480px'  ],
			xxsmall:  [ null,      '360px'  ]
		});
* Just like what I did before, specifying the properties for each width seems to be the way to go.

Nov. 26, 2022 (Saturday)

* I think I need to do a reference code for Django once again.
* Found a good Django text to speech reference @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zuREP-EXYE&ab_channel=NiteshSingh and thanks to this guy..
	Nitesh Singh. Also pyautogui is amazing. I can specify the location of the mouse in a good interval of time. 


Nov. 25, 2022 (Friday)

* Thank God it's friday.
* Manage to solve a minor issue with Django with my templates not being recognied, it turns out, I forgot to register the app in INSTALLED_APPS at 
	settings.py. Also, been trying to incorporate tailwind to Django.

Nov. 24, 2022 (Thursday)

* Revisited my old red bubble gui application. I managed to made it run again but niot without a few setbacks. I was greeted with the error involving
	collection and MutableMapping. The upgraded python version seems to be the culprit. I was able to execute the program once more by installing
	a virtual environment in there with 'python3 -m venv thisgui'. I installed requests to help me in changing the python version to 2.28.1. I 
	re-installed in there selenium and webdriver and pillow. That was how, I was able to run the code. I'll deal with the rest of the errors later.
* Revisited text-to-speech. I am reminded that the bigger priority is choosing which voice is sufficient. I think I found something best. I'm going to 
	make a Django web site using text-to-speech for the testimonies I would be putting in there.
* I'm gonna have to learn about scheduling so that a new entry or testimony would appear at the site everday for a specific period of time.
* Manage to run text-t0-speech reference code at chrome and not on firefox but still, the program pauses for some reason. I'll resolve it later.

Nov. 23, 2022 (Wednesday)

* I think I need a third monitor.
* 5:1 is a good ratio for applying in glassdoor versus onlinejobs.ph
* Manage to setup a live Nextjs site using one of my domains which is 'www.jmwebgo.com'. Also, it is good to know that the SSL certificate comes along
	with it. I did this by configuring the DNS at the host site 'godaddy.com'. I change the CNAME to 'www cname.vercel-dns.com'.
	Now, my online journal web app can be access at two definite sites. However, I haven't costumized the code to accomodate the database
	Mongodb for 'jmwebgo.com' so the one I can go to right now is still in Vercel. Still, this is a good start and I can more confidently chat
	kuya Rich regarding my willingness to build a website for the church provided they gave me a good UI/UX design.
* This is how to activate virtual environment on your Django app:
	(1)	Go to main folder terminal and type 'python3 -m venv <name-of-project>'. Type in the name of the project and not the app. 
	(2)	Activate virtual environment with 'source <name-of-project>/bin/activate' 
	(3) 	Install Django with 'python3 -m pip install Django'
	(4) 	Type in 'cd <name-of-your-app>' and 'python3 manage.py runserver'
	(5)	You can type in 'pip freeze' to verify. If you see only a handful, your virtual environment is active.
* Manage to deploy a Django web app to railway.app. It utilizes the same method line in Vercel where it connects to your github account and used the repo
	to launch the code. This is a good start I guess and the next phase would be deploying the app to a costume site of mine in the near future.
* It appears that the CNAME is the one responsible to deploying your web app to a costume site.
* As I get myself more familiar with pythonanywhere, it seems that creating a virtual environment in its bash console is different from when you do when
	you are in your local mode.
* I seem to be having trouble running my todo_app Django app to pythonanywhere.com. I assume it has something to do with the directory. As the error 
	logs point out, `No module named 'todo_app'` seems to be the culprit.
* I proceeded to delete some repositories that aren't really much to keep.
* Thank You Lord! I was finally able to host my Django app to pythonanywhere.com. This would be the second hosting of my app since the first would be 
	in 'railway.app'.
	
Nov. 22, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Practice some code challenges at hackerrank and manage to solve two. A good habit for debuggin would be to use '--' to separate loops varying 
	in degrees. Still, haven't solved the problem involving permutation though.

Nov. 20, 2022 (Sunday)

* Finally was able to use react-reveal by replacing 'save' in npm install react-reveal --save with 'force'
* Now have a good reference for scroll animation with javascript involving a loop.
* Found out that you can identify an element with any of the words in its name separated by spaces.

Nov. 19, 2022 ( Saturday)

* Worked on my online portfolio. Instead of making it better, the bitter part is what got me. Arrgghh! My production is currently ruined and thus, I won't
 be having an online portfolio as of the moment until I fix this.
* npm create vite@latest -- This is a good way to replace npx create-react-app

Nov. 18, 2022 (Friday)

* Worked on my online portfolio.

Nov. 17, 2022 (Thursday)

* I feel like I have been slacking these past few days. In some ways, those tech layoffs I read from time to time isn't really much helping. I guess aside
	from the consistency is one should really believe on his abilities. I got to have the positivity to look forward to the better life coding
	can do for me. The fog is thick  as of the moment but If I can program a way to clear out the blur, I can see what wonders awaits of me.

Nov. 12, 2022 (Saturday)

* Added a button for feedbacks in my journal web app. The hard part is basically done and now, costumizing comes next. I used swal as the input method to
	take the feedbacks and after that, the result is put into an async function sending it to the database and then, another swal would appear
	telling the user of the success. This needs further modification as I ought to take the response data and display it. This means that either a 
	success or fail notification would come into the scene.
* I've noticed that taking the data from Mongodb database is taking its time to display. I have yet to learn how to convert the list entries into one
	that displays only a small portion and when you scroll down, that's when the rest of the data is shown or taken into account. Rght now, it would
	take some time so I'll just leave it to future me for now.

Nov. 11, 2022 (Friday)

* Practice solving some hackerrank problems. There is one problem I haven't solved yet and it involves one with the chocolate bar I think.

Nov. 10, 2022 (Thursday) 

* I guess it's safe to say that when you are learning something, you go through a blurry phase when everything seems to be out of place but at the end
	of the tunnel, everything just falls into place.

Nov. 9, 2022 (Wednesday)

* My learnings have definitely been lacking. I need to set my priorities right. I'll make a count-to-learn entry once again but this time for deploying
	Django on a site.
* Tried 2 coding challenges as a mock test at hackerrank.com. The first one was a familiar one involving finding the median and I solved it but the
	second one involves a matrix to find the optimal sum at upper left quadrant of matrix. Solved additional one by debugging code involving XOR.

Nov. 8, 2022 (Tuesday)

* I'm gonna try to deploy django at one of my sites which is jmwebgo.com

Nov. 7, 2022 (Monday)

* I got to admit. Learning Django seems to be unmotivating for me. My first choise for web development would be Nextjs so this is just secondary for me
	with this one.
* I failed a simple coding challenge. The next time, I'll do a coding interview, I'll make sure to open Vscode for debugging purposes.

Nov. 6, 2022 (Sunday)

* I got to be more familiazrize with class-base django and the function one.
* The count method seems to be effective for me.

Nov. 5, 2022 (Friday)

* Currently listening to sir Chris Sean talks. He is a good inspiration really.
* I think I have to accept that the first four years would be a constant grind for me and the fifth year would be the one where the real great ones would
	come. I need to believe in myself and challenge myself frequently from one big project to another. 
* I'm starting from scratch with Django as my formet files were nonfunctional.
* This is a good reference for learning Django.. https://realpython.com/django-todo-lists/
* Looking back to the interview I had the other day, I think sir Alex was hopeful that I would pass the test. He was kind enough to give me some hints
	and he was also considerate. But, stuff happens and I can only hope for the better next time as I continue to improve my skills.
* This is an observation of mine with django. On the project side, the settings.py and urls.py are part of the primary files while others are secondary 
	while in the app side, there are also two which can be considered to be primary. These are urls.py and views.py. I don't why the developers 
	didn't just named views.py to be 'functions.py' since it is where we can see store the functions weuse for our app. secondary would be the 
	templates folder, admin.py and models.py. The rest are tertiary.
* Made a Railway account for what it's worth.
* How to deploy a django project with staticfiles on vercel @ https://www.devmaesters.com/blog/15 --> I need to check this tutorial in the near future. 
* Wasn't able to upload my django app here in github but I'll be looking forward to do so.
* Dedicated time spent on learning about coding: 4 hours..
* Made a problem solving insights file.

Nov. 3, 2022 (Thursday)

* def leftmostindex(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)


    for x in range(n):
        for z in matrix:
            if z[x] == 1:
                return x + 1
                
                    
    return 0
    
    This should have been my answer to the warm-up code that was being asked of me but I bombed. At this point, is doing really for me? I need to practice
    some more. I have some few suggestions on how the interview went. The warm-up coding part should have had at least two examples. Three would have 
    been a great number at that. I should have asked mr interviewer if I can see the sample input cases. I don't know but my nerves kept getting the
    best of me. I couldn't think clearly.

Nov. 2, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Apply at indeed for two jobs.

Nov. 1, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Need to sleep
* Stumbled upon a no-code topic of a video in youtube. It's quite interesting. Bubble.io seems to be a good one for it.

October 31, 2022 (Monday)

* An addition to the backlist of this project is fixing the update button so that it wouldn't change the already set date created part. I think 
  I can do that using a conditional that if there is something already there, no change would be made. It turns out I just need to remove the date
  part and now this one is resolved.
* Created an account to https://www.pythonanywhere.com. I would like to deploy a django sample web app.
* I have to promote my site on my own and maybe possibly put some add on it. I think this is a good enough hook.
	"Hi, Is it okay if I can get a review for this site on your spare time?"
* Finally was able to setup the NewPage button specifying a new blank entry by modifying the object to be send to the mongodb database.
* I think I should focus more on marketing or promoting my vercel web app.
* I may be able to optimize my vercel online web app even more using the watch() method of mongodb but this remains to be tested.
* It's been a while since I last integrated myself with django so it will be some time for me to fully graso once again its concept. I'm planning on 
  making a web app to utilize my python code which automates designs uploading to red bubble. and hopefully be able to compete on the big tech out there
  for a share in the market.
* manage to deploy a django sample web app in here...http://jmarkzcod8r.pythonanywhere.com/

October 30, 2022 (Sunday)

* Thought I could put reload page function in a loop with break condition in Useeffect but it didn't help at all. Oh well!
* One of the problem with my vercel online journal app is exclusivity of data which is something I ought to take note in the future.
* I noticed that as you grow your online portfolio, the more people are open to be working with you. I can say that the past weeks were better than the
	previous as I got more interactions from potential companies I could be working for in the future.
* Finally was able to install skype by using snap.
* Well now, this is a noteworthy problem from leetcode which is hard. You have n flower seeds. Every seed must be planted first before it can begin to 
  grow, then bloom. Planting a seed takes time and so does the growth of a seed. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays plantTime and growTime, of 
  length n each:
    plantTime[i] is the number of full days it takes you to plant the ith seed. Every day, you can work on planting exactly one seed. You do not have 
    	to work on planting the same seed on consecutive days, but the planting of a seed is not complete until you have worked plantTime[i] days on 
	planting it in total.
    growTime[i] is the number of full days it takes the ith seed to grow after being completely planted. After the last day of its growth, the flower 
    	blooms and stays bloomed forever.
    From the beginning of day 0, you can plant the seeds in any order.
    Return the earliest possible day where all seeds are blooming.
	* class Solution:
	    def earliestFullBloom(self, plantTime: List[int],
				  growTime: List[int]) -> int:	
		cur_plant_time = 0
		result = 0
		indices = sorted(range(len(plantTime)), key=lambda x: -growTime[x]) 
		for i in indices:
		    cur_plant_time += plantTime[i]
		    result = max(result, cur_plant_time + growTime[i])
		return result
* Solve 3 intermediate coding challenges
* +5 on jobs applied. It seems that being a python or programming instructor pays quite well.

October 29, 2022 (Saturday)

* Solve 10 intermediate coding challenges at edabit.com which also took out my freemium period.
* I learned that you can set a default value to an argument. okay.
* // --> operator that divides and discards the fractional part in python
* My vercel app is 90% complete. Thank You Lord.
* I have a few ideas on how I can better my vercel online journal web app. First is to update the date created in the fomart of something like this.
	" 18-Oct-2022 (Thu) ". Second is the configuration of the info button so that information about the site would pop-up. Third is to implement
	the ctrl + right-click in the buttons that correspons to your entries in a way that the name would be configure so that it would serve as the 
	title for the Entries.

October 28, 2022 (Friday)

* make it a habit that whenever you use an async function, iclude the parameters (req, res)
* 3 things for good database integration: (1) Connection (2) Model (3) Schema
* TypeError: t.versions.node is undefined --> You'll get this error if you'll try using mongoose in the client side. Only server side is acceptable.
* I'm really having a hard time creating a model that corresponds to each user. I wanted the app to create a new model for each user but it seems 
  I'd have to go for plan B.	

October 25, 2022 (Tuesday)

* I'm starting to reconsider that recruiters may not be that bad at all if they can find you a good deal.
* Finish the english test on one of my applications at devsoft.ph
* Tried to upgrade my linux but encountered an error. I'm a bit hesitant to upgrade now. I guess I'll do it once I bought another spare laptop.
* Started once again to work on my side project which is an onlie journal. i need to setup the database so that each user would have his own collection 
	or model and I think I would have to use the dynamic routing setting up the four methods: GET, POST, PUT, OPTIONS in there. I had a hard time 
	sending a query with useState. I think I need to use a list.

October 24, 2022 (Monday)

* Carry on

October 23, 2022 (Sunday)

* I need to make a new Schema which containes the emails that are registered on the site.

October 22, 2022 (Saturday)

* Continue to filling out necessary tasks for interview. Uvocorp.com raised their prices for short orders but for me, I won't be accepting orders that
	are less than $40

October 20, 2022 (Thursday)

* Just updated the file I sent as an order to a costumer in uvocorp.

October 19, 2022 (Wednesday)

* I need to set up my web app with nextjs so that it would make a new database for each user.

October 18, 2022 (Tuesday)

* I can't believe I skip some logs due to unsaved ones and due to me being busy. Arrgghhhh!!
* Finally solve merge conflict issue by going to the terminal directory of the conflicting file and following the instructions dictated in the terminal.

October 14, 2022 (Friday)

* I'm looking at using getServerSideProps, getStaticPaths and getStaticProps if I won't be able to resolve this issue with axios not being able 
	to get data on vercel. I think I need a reference project.
* The good thing is that I was able to resolve the issue I was having with using '.map' and that is by using 'index*2' and 'index*3' as keys.
* Confirmed a force-assigned python web programming order. Let's see how I may be able to do this.
* process.env can be console.log but the output would be on the terminal and not on the browser as it will produce an undefined in there.
	I can use JSON.strinify on one of the environment variables and still the output can only be seen on the terminal.
* When exporting a function from a different folder, one ought to lose 'default' and it better be not inside the pages folder.
* The jsx file seems to be superior rathen then js file.
* Better check from time to time if any .env file is uploaded to your repo and do something about it.
* The good news is that I have finally incorporated nextjs and mongodb. It required some manipulating with the urls. It took a while but I'm glad 
	I finally was able to do it. I'll do the polising later as there is still one thing I need to configure and it is to incorporate a database 
	for each user. In doing so, i could think of using 'uid' and 'email' provided by google in doig this. I think I also need to take out the 
	'name' field and change the 'date' to 'date Modified'. I also need to modify the app back to its default state of checking tokens.
* In the near future, I would be learning about stripe and something about the incorporation of the payment system. The thought of
	hosting multiple business websites thus is a general possibility for me just like what I saw in a previous video.
* error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Jmarkzcod8r/firebase-auth-two.git' --> this is the first time i encounterd this
	error and I think this happened because I did some changes in the github repo online and not on vscode. I should note this.
* It's official. As a good tip, don't edit on the browser with your repo. I'll have to get back to this later.

October 13, 2022 (Thursday)

* Gain some good insights with the dynamic property of pages with the back-end. Thank You Lord.
* Found the error that has been causing me some issus with axios.post on the front-end and it is with the
	status being set to 201 instead of 200.
* Don't take out the dependecy array in useEffect.
* Had a problem with posting at database. It turns out that I just have to wait a few seconds and let the compiling complete before I do anything. 
	The way I think I see it is that any changes made to the back-end needs a restart at the most.
* Almost done with my online journal. Now, I need to configure in a way that each user has a database of his owm and I think I can do
	that using user's unique google user id.
* SO CLOSE YET SO FAR...

October 12, 2022 (Wednesday)

* I had a recent interview and it went well. But, my English skills definitely had to work an extra mile. Nicholas was a nice guy and let's just hope 
	for the best. 'Good job to me' I guess...
* Who could have knew that input tag is affected by text-align and not justify-content. 
* Made a sup-file for this repo named 'Potential Front-End Interview Questions'. This ought to be useful, I think.

October 11, 2022 (Tuesday)

* 'new Client({name:'Joy', desc:'nice', comments:'complicated'}).save()' This is how I got to save to the mongodb database without the use of express or
	axios. The 'new' command helps. The next thing I need to do is study about the switch cases. Also, I', having trouble with the axios.post as it
	would return error 500 or something but the neat part is that I am able to add data to Mongodb thru the frontend also by using axios.
	This is probably the timesaver for me. I set my code up like this one and the thing work at a fine level.
	const res = await axios.post('https://httpbin.org/post', { hello: 'world' }, {
  		headers: {	     // 'application/json' is the modern content-type for JSON, but some
				    // older servers may use 'text/json'.
				    // See: http://bit.ly/text-json
				    'content-type': 'text/json'			 }	});
* I need to prepare for hackerrank. I have an exam due in ten days. Also, I need to be more familiariza with the key and indes when using the '.map'

res.data.headers['Content-Type']; // text/json

October 10, 2022 (Monday)

* Having a hard time with axios posting some data in Mongodb. This was not the case on one of my working references using express.js. It's a bit confusing
	apparently. Maybe it has something to do with <FormControl>. I don't know at this point. Also, the issue with _id is annoying and there seems
	to be no good answer on the web. I could reconsider having a 'cred' for credential field on my objects to avoid manipulating ids. Let's see.

October 9, 2022 (Sunday)

* Continue to work on my online side Project. When dealing with getting data in collection, it is best to follow the format. all small letters and ending
	with an 's' are they should be. the 's' gets taken out when specifing in the 'client.js'. Look at example for further verification. Note: When
	changing databases, restart 'npm run dev'. Renaming 'client' for 'collection' or 'col' is a considerable one.
* I'm having a hard time logging in to wordpress Phpmyadmin. Just like before, wordpress, never fails to put some frustrations but let's see if I would
	have the time to resolve this.
	

October 8, 2022 (Saturday)

*  Finally fiexed this error,.OverwriteModelError: Cannot overwrite `client` model once compiled. it should be mongoose.models.client || 
	mongoose.model("client", ClientSchema); The previous was that the first 'client' has a capital for 'c'.
*  Got some first insights with Mongodb vscode extension. Use('DATABASE') ---> this is use to specify the database we would be working on. 
	When creating a database,the below command is necesary.db.createCollection('COLLECTIONNAME') ---> This is use to create a database with 
	a collection inside it with an initial content of '{ "ok":1}'.
*  When getting infos using await or res, the default is labeled to 'data'. Naming it to others will result in error. Use console.log to verify.
*  You can use useState to store an object provided that you would only use its children and not the whole package or you would have to use 
	'JSON.stringify' to convert it first to a string. Using this method, you would use less code. I think I'll go with this one for static 
	web pages but what I am building has some dynamic variables so I might reconsider.

October 7, 2022 (Friday)

* When I tried connecting to the Mongodb using the clone that was working before, I was having a hard time. I think I need to bring back on my 
        references that worked well. Another is that I need to trim the sample databases I had. I didn't expect it was that many so for now I'll 
        leave only one which is the 'mflix database'. When I got to connect to the database, I need to get the data and put in a div or element
        tag as what I've already planned.

October 6, 2022 (Thursday)

* I'm having a hard time with mongodb actually. I think I need to break this down little by little. First of all, I need to set a connection to 
	the database I possess now. There are a lot of examples there. I need to setup a function that checks whether a specific schema is there.
	From what I see async functions can have the arguments of request(req) and respons(res) and you can specify a return json file to showcase
	the result which is most likely in the 'api' folder. Also, I need to set a sample js file under the pages that when you open it in the browser,
	it will return a div but also execute an async function that involves req and res to the mongodb database and put those results in the div and 
	in doing this, I will have to use 'useState'

October 5, 2022 (Wednesday)

* How to send data to mongoose:
	Create 3 js files:	
		* connection.js ===> This is where your api is
		* Schema.js ===> This specifies your folder and subfolder. This is where models are.
		* Users.js ===> This can be named to 'data.js'. This is where your 'to-be-uploaded' data is.
				Connect -> Specify -> Send		
* It seems that the price of scalability through mongodb is some a bit more of code complication. I think the hierarchy for the datas in Mongodb 
	are first Model and then the sub which is schema. Model -> schema
	Note: schemas is lowercase for all letters, start with a small letter and end with an 's'
* I need to make a mini test app with inputs and test buttons and send them to the database.
* I guess it's safe to say "Getting into the tech business has never been easier said than done."

October 4, 2022 (Tuesday)

Reminder: Use '{...}' for objects and '(...)' for keys or object children. Don't forget to use '{}' on objects when using them as arguments or 
	parameters of a function. When passing function or arguments from main js to a component js, use '{... ...}' for parameters.
* Found out that I get an error for 'usernav.js' due to its useEffect calling a useState inside of it. I think I have to find a way around this problem.
* Had a bit of a problem with useState inside useeffect getting errors due to infinite loop. Got it solved by setting up an empty dependency array in 
	the useEffect of the component 'usernav.js' and disabling eslint althouh I am still thankful for trying out eslint quick fixes which none of them 
	resolve my issue full well. At this point, I think it would be better to include an empty dependency array whenever I use useEffect.
	As what I thought, 'block' can mostly only be responsive if it has components with properties of 'inline-block'. The inline-block holds more 
	priority rather than setting 'height:auto' for block.

October 3, 2022 (Monday)

* Continue working on my nextjs side project.

* Managed to get the current date for today with javascript. Now, the next i think would be emojis. Got a minor error with 'document not defined' but
	it's okay now. This helped 'if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {...  ...}'.
* Fixed a minor css issue caused by 'p-... pt-...' giving an overflow to the web page.
* Continue working with database for firebase-auth-two.
* I think it would be a good idea to bring out 3 test button right at the start.
* Setting up useeffect with data integration seems to be a recipe for disaster especially when your app starts to scale. Binding it to a button pretty 
	much is the way to go the way I see it so far.
* On the process of getting to know how ' onAuthStateChanged ' works with firebase. It seems to remember your last login and the problemw with this 
	is that if a user wishes to login with a differentg gmail account, then he would have a terrible time indeed. My web app seems to be
	automatically signing in with Google which I really don't want it to. It started with my local but shifted to the vercel version. I think this 
	is in the browser. Okay, now I know why. I've pre-logged in to my google account on the browser and it reflected to my logging in. Deleting 
	the database where user.id can be seen didn't help so there's that.
* As what I've read, providing unique key for using '.map' method helps the virtual DOM to listen to changes. I think it is a good practice to do so.

October 1, 2022 (Saturday)

* Added some new tips of how to lower reads on my previouse entry after reviewing fireship video. I had a little issue with mongodb with user not 
	having access to write in database. It turns out, I just need to configure the role for user. The good thing is that I successfully written some
	data on my trial database at Mongodb. Also, I found a tutorial that incorporates nextjs and mongodb although there is a possibilit I may need to
	restart my web app at vercel.

September 30, 2022 (Friday)

* Work all the more in my nextjs project. Added additional logins like facebook and yahoo but the backend is still to be operational and i have to 
	look for a tutorial detailing how to set up native email and password login. Just like codepen, desygne and mui has some good ui desings.
* Practice my coding javascript skills with (10) easy questions and (4) easy for now: @edabit.com.. so farm this is a good site and according to their
	site, they will allow up to 15 'freemium' questions before they would ask for payment. I guess that answers the question of how they are making
	money. Also, I like that their affiliate marketing is global.
	 To convert a number to a binary string:	use 'toString(2)'
	 To convert object -> string word:		use 'JSON.stringify('object').replaceAll (',','')
	 To convert string to an array: 		use Array.from('string') 
* I know this is indirectly connected to coding but I just got my first sale to red bubble. I got paid $0.19. Yeay!! If It gives the idea to make a web
	app that automates uploading designs to red bubble but I think I'm gonna have to use Django for this one since the legacy code is in python. I
	guess it can be considered as another one of my projects.

September 28, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Saw a video with 'Tech with Tim' and it was nice to know the hiring side with tips.

September 27, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Deployed a sample project to vercel using google login authentication but just like before, i kept getting the 404 when getting user data 
	from google. Gonna have to try again later at the vercel web app.
* Had a minor proble with vercel login google authentication. It turns out that I just have to add the domain to the 'authorized domains' at 
	the 'sign-in method' in firebase.
* I think it's good to use 'block' as container for elements with 'inline-block' properties.
* I think I know how to fix the broken photo everytime I login with google.
* If I were to rebuild onlinejobs.ph then I would choose Nextjs as my full framework, firebase for the authentication and database ,though I may 
 	consider also Mongodb. I would use vercel to help me with the deployment though I've tried hosting a single page web app website in the 
	past with firebase. I'll use github for version control. For the css, I would use tailwind since it utilizes minimal words using also 
	'className' of elements and since it has great documentation. Seting up the navbar seems to be easier when I'm using nextjs compared to 
	django as the way I see it so it wouldn't be much of a problem. If I were to use AWS, then I think it would take me a week or less to learn it. 
	I may set up the securiyt rules for a user's data to only be writable if the user is login.  The login process of onlinejobs.ph doesn't 
	utilize google authentiation or similar provides like yahoo or facebok so a standard one would be use. 
* Got an email as a consideration for a senior back-end developer. But, just like any other, I didn't qualiy for it since I don't have the degree or the
	necessary experience for the job. It would be nice though if you could have an offer of $50 per hour or more one day. I know it's possible in
	this industry. For now, I just have to keep learning and elevating the value that I can give potentially.
* I set up useeffect to take the data of the photoURL and just like what I logged before, making a function inside it and then calling it right afterwards
	seems to be better than putting up a list of dependencies. I setup a useState for photoURL which in turn works extremely well. As a habit, I 
	should degine my variables I will be using the page in useState.

September 26, 2022 (Monday)

* Using async doesn't necessaruly mean you use await. Solved an issue by adding 'JSON.parse' to 'localStorage.getItem'
* Instead of console.log use 'useState' instead for debugging and performance
* You can try display flex and configure with margin and padding as a css tip
* Use padding as first priority and margin as second or experiment with both.
* Using tailwind with nextjs is nice.

September 25, 2022 (Sunday)

* Firebase config problem? restarting might be the solution.
* After making env.local. keys and setting it up in gitignore -restart IDE as necessary.
* After some time, I found out that what should be 'accessToken' was 'accesToken' which gave me errors.
* JS callbacks are good for functions with result as parameter.
* I think it's best to do localStoage.getItem at useEffect.
* To avoid using dependencies in useEffect, define a function and call it right after.
* I'm gonna experiment with session storage soon.
* The 'typeof' method proves to be useful in debugging.
* using 'async-await' under 'useEffect' seems to be very beneficial. This was because when I looked at the console, too much rendering was being made.
* Got a working reference of what I would want my site to be thanks to an indian dude. Also, tailwind is aweosme. I really should be practicing it more.

September 23, 2022 (Friday)

* Finally was able to configure the authentication of my site 'discbook' but it still got a long way to go.

September 22, 2022 (Thursday)

* Use an access token for one of my repo: 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 . Took out 'yarn.lock' to enable 'npm' to run instead on mrojecty nextjs
  project. make sure 'npm run build' is updated before deploying to github and then eventually to vercel and Used const myloader to generate an 
  image in a vercel deployment project page. Retrieveing and making jason files for data seems to be the way to go in the form of a dictionary.
* Got myself a working static navbar yet to be responsive but it's a start.

September 21, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Can't really stay up late tonight so by 0100H I'm out. It's good that I finally have a glimpse of a 'backmeup' project I have in mind of building. The
  	linux command has a tool that list all the changes made in logs in a certain period of time. 
* In terms of building discbook:
	Framework:	I think I'll have this specifications. I'll be using Nextjs for this one but although the routing capabilities of the
			framework is phenomenal, firebase isn't that much friendly to dynamic pages as I have to get the help of things such as google 
			cloud functions. But, just like react, there are ways to go about this. I can make a single page app but the problem would 
			be when the 'refresh' gets called and there would be chaos. I can use the css property 'display: none' and 'visibility:hidden' 
			for this one. 
	Back-end: 	I'll use firebase for the database and authentication. I'll use google and yahoo mostly for this. In the end, I'll have access
			to a list of user and their emails for what it's worth. I don't think I'll be utilizing the email and password for now. One 
			important thing to note is that as early as now, I'll learn how to use one document for the entire database just like how
			fireship did it in able to not acquire colossal fees.
	Database:	I'll use object oriented programming as i think it does well in keeping my data uniform. The data for authentication is already 
			handles so a user would have this list of data for him: {Devotionals:[],Prayers:{Current:[], Answered:[]}, Events:[], Fasting:[]}.
			Just like in the 'to-do list', the map function for array would be utilized for this. In able for me to make the database the way
			I want it to,I need to have a reference and this means going back to the video fireship posted and coding along the way.
	API: 		I'll utilize a bible api so that whenever it is clicked, a form will appear and after filling up the form, a pop-up will be one
			screen to showcase the chapter being sought for.
	Background:	I think I'll dsplay the navigation at the left side in a vertical position so that a nice background can be seen. Also, in the 
			header I'll display a verse.
	HomePage:	Maybe similar to 'whiteseed.live' so the things I'll be including in the navbar would be: About ( this is a simple site designed
			for anyone to have an online 
	Messaging:	I'll include this one and the ability to see other people's profiles. Maybe I'll use Mongdb as the database for this one.
* In terms of backmeup, I haven't quite decided with this one yet but I think I'll go first with this one as it is a smaller project compared to 
	my christian social media app 'discbook'.

September 20, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Next.js is a beast! It's routing is easy and I like it very well.
* Started learning with PHP. I think it isn't hard to learn since by this point, I now have an intermediate level of understanding and knowledge
	with python and javascript.
* I think I'll try applying for jobs in Singapore.

September 19, 2022 (Monday)

* Donwloaded the 'life360' app which makes up close to what my app would be. This is gonna be a challenge and I think it'll take me weeks before deployment 
  and after that would be marketing. I know of a coworket who is a good at selling but I have yet to decide how I can partner with him. Sir Dongjay...
* Download Android studio for whatever it's worth as per the tutorial video recommended.
* Finally able to run my first flutter app. 'sudo snap install flutter --classic' ... this helped me in a recent issue.
* In the flutter site, there is a template that involves a location app with google and the code is in github so I guess that's beneficial for me. Yay!
* This will come in handy. "https://flutter.github.io/samples"
* I think I should make a blog site of my own where I can just pour out all my thoughts.
* Familiarize myself more with OOP with react. I think this is the tools you would need for react and knowing this, you would be just fine:
	* useState, useEffect, useRef , async function, declarative functions, function expression, '.map' method --> this appears to be pretty useful 
		though I still need to master it and last I think is Object-Oriented Programming.

September 18, 2022 (Sunday)

* Practice my coding skills with javascript and this time utilizing node.js for it which works pretty well compared to opening a browser.
* Javascript seems to be a bit harder to learn than python but this is my take for it. There is a 'micro' and a 'macro;. This is true for functions
	and if statements. The 'continue' has the same function of skipping a specific iteration as well as in python. The forEach is used to iterate
	through the elements of a given array. There are many ways to remove duplicates in a list and that's by filter, set, forEach, Reduce,
	Underscore JS, Array.prototype.unique, 
* The '.includes' si a boolean that iterates through an array looking if a particular element is present. Thus the questions mark (?) followed by two
	actions either for true or false can be used for it.
* The '.map' is the younger brother of 'forEach' the way I see it. 
* Apparently, there are some things called 'no code app builder' which I will be looking through soon enough.
* Found a cool navbar code using only css and html. "&#9776" this string signifies a hamburger menu.

September 17, 2022 (Saturday)

* Prepared for the testgorilla test but still bombed. I think this is the 5th one. Now, It's safe to say that getting into tech normally isn't
	a walk in the park. 
* I need to practice on javascript leetcode more. five problems at a time may beneficial for me practicing the 'rule of 5'.


September 15, 2022 (Thursday)

* One of these days, I'm gonna have to incorporate react with next.js.
* Got my first insights of working with the rules with firebase database. Apparently, you can do a lot with it such as configuring the users and also 
	working with time to include it on your rules. Comments are in my 'trialdb' database. Also, I need to get back one of these days to the way
	fireship reduce pricing cost with the use of database from a video of his I had come across once.
* Noteworthy is that firebase pricing can be unpredictable and can lead to a lot of trouble if i don't master it as soon as I can.
* How Not To Burn Money in the Cloud:		
					(1)	Setup Budget Alerts Globally --> Try to use aws budget actions if applicable or use pub sub
					(2)	Do not create infinite loops in the cloud!!! (3x)
					(3)	Don't configure things to scale when you're just messing around.
					(4)	Think about algorithms
					(5)	Secure your app (like apis, datas, security rules...etc)
					(6) 	Minimize document reads
					(7)	Configure rules
					

September 14, 2022 (Wednesday)

* I now have a working reference for signing in with firebase with google authentication using a pop up window. It seems that 'PedroTech' tops the list
	of reliable github repos I can fork in the near future. Also, I read about trusted and untrusted providers so that's nice.
* Still need to look at other auth samples with firebase.
* I shoudl remember to use <iframe> tag if I want to embed some good videos on site.
* Got myself to try Figma for the first time to make a draft of what a social media web app for christian looks like. I think I'll focus on it being a 
	writer-mode kind of site so my main featues would more likely be: 	Devotionals  Log Book	Blog   Prayers   Bible  I'll think of the rest
	for later.
* I see that firebase can also incorporate stripe for payments which is nice.

September 13, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Found these awesome site that 'Programiz.com' which is like an online editor to do some coding although the limitations are yet to be recognized fully.
* I don't know if it's true but they say that 'A leetcode a day keeps unemployment away.'
* Practice my coding skills with python for 30 mins with leetcode. Haven't solved the problem yet since my 30-min set time for it expired. 
* Gonna have to get a certification with Azure through microsoft learn as recommended by sit Franc.
* I'm having trouble with useEffect with firebase authentication as of the moment.
* Made a not so perfect reference for user authentication with firebase. It isn't perfect but it's a start.

September 12, 2022 (Monday)

* Learn more about OOP with react.
* I'm happy right now. I bought a new domain at godaddy.com 'dischub.online' at only P65 for one year. I have yet to decide which tools and frameworks
	I'll use for it. I could go with the usual firebase for the backend or I'll try a different aproach with Django. My most obvious choice would be
	to use React for the frontend or if I'm feeling experimental, I could go learn about Vue and incorporate it in it.
* I 've taken two exams last week and I both failed at them so it means, I still have a long way to go in harnessing my skills as a programmer but one
	thing that's good for me is that I type fast. 53 wpm is my peak when i tried my skill at livechat.com.

September 11, 2022 (Sunday)

* First time sending an application to devjobsremote.com.
* Why didn't I make an online log sooner?
* Well now, this is a bummer! Git deleted my changes. I guess it isn't as reliable as I thought it would be. Before, I push my codes to github, I should 
	really make another copy here in my local laptop. AAArrrggghhhhhhh!!!!!!
* I should use Glassdoor more! The problem with is that it would ask for years of experience so a newbie like me would be at a disadvantage.
* 

September 10, 2022 (Saturday)

* Finished my test evaluation with https://learn.alg.academy/main .
* Conduct a 40-questions test with desygner.com with a max of 65 mins. No python. Only javascript involved. The questions were definitely challenging.
* I think I need to have a new strategy. Onlinejobs.ph is great but I'm gonna try other sites.
* These are the Best Sites for Finding Remote Work Online: Remote-Only Job Boards. I'll give my review for each one soon. Some of these sites are 
	high-end which means that if you don't have a minimum of one experience, it'll be an uphill battle for you.

    FLEXJOBS. ...	   - You need a subscription for these so I probable won't be using this much.

September 9, 2022 (Friday)

* Devjobsremote - This seems to be a promising site.

September 8, 2022 (Thursday)

* Had my first interview as a python tutor. The exams were fun to be honest. The site was meant for kids so the atmosphere was not something I
  	encounter everyday. Still, it was great. I still have two days to.
* I need to confirm if the average waiting time to deploy using firebase is 10mins. In addition, I made a new 'build' folder when I was having 
	some issues deploying a new version to my site just recently.

September 7, 2022 (Wednesday)

* had a reoccuring problem with react navbar but it's okay now when I set the heigh to a specified value.
* Deployed ann updated version to whiteseed.live.
* Had trouble with deploying new version to whiteseed.live again. I think I'll try Netlify and see what happens.
* Found an insane job offer based on California. $30-$36 per hour for a remote junior developer. That's more than I make in a single day 
	in my current job.
* California seems to offer great salaries for developers. Anyway, I should focus more on applying to company's own website rather than onlinejobs.oh
	or indeed or glassdoor in the most part.
* I just remembered one of the downsides in my parts starting out his tech journey is applying and answering the question of how many years you have
	been into this and that.
* In using the '@media(max-width: 'value' ) in css,.the tags must be in the same css. Inline css isn't therefore recommended.
* Ctrl + shift + A ---> This is useful for commenting out parts in a line

September 6, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Made two appointments. One for Weddesday at 1pm - 1:30pm and another for thursday at 10.30am china standard time which is 11.30am in ph time.
* Well, this is a first. I had an interview a while back but it never pushed through due to schedule conflicts and the company was a startup so
	it's a downside. I think.
* "Once you get one, you could always get more." as Aaron Jack,.programmer youtuber said about interview. Also, he recommends glassdoor..20%
* I was wondering why my changes wouldn't reflect in the localhost server and found out that the problems lies with the import. React seems to have this
  ability to change the import destination or that's what it seems. I need to observe further. On the positive side, I finally able to build the backend
  for the questionnaires. Thank You Lord!.
* Made a decent mobile version for whiteseed.live. Hurrah! Thank You Lord!

September 5, 2022 (Monday)

* Made a collection of my sample websites. https://jmarkzcod8r.github.io/Website-Sample-Collection/
* I'm getting closer to finishing my whiteseed.live quiz app.
* I got an email saying my application moved forward with regards to that python coding instructor part.

September 4, 2022 (Sunday)

* I was finally able to manipulate a todo app to send entries to the database with multiple variables. It seems I am having some brain fogs on what to
	do at the moment but I can do this. 
* Work on my bible quiz app more. This time, I'm glad I am able to go more.

September 2, 2022 (Friday)

* I should use codepen.io more. It's like an online cool editor but the setup is fast and lightweight. I could use it while react is still loading to
  to save some valuable time. Also, the way i use position:sticky is that i make a div with position:absolute and then inside that is another div with 
  'position:sticky'. Recently, I found out that there is another better way to do this by using only one div or container and then with this properties
  "position: -webkit-sticky; position: sticky; top: 0;". In addition, I played around with absolute and relative positions property.

September 1, 2022 (Thursday)

* I should remember that 'models.py' is used to create entries to the database of django while 'admin.py' is for creating users.
* Finally, I have a working reference for django. Still, I haven't used the three. The reference just uses react and django but it's a start.
* I think i finally figured out why there was no POST on the previous reference video i tired to go for and it's because either the models or view.py
	wasn't configured right. Also, i think the router needs some clarifications.
* Okay, if 'pyrebase' serves as the bridge for your Django backend to the Firebase database, then axios makes the connection for your frontend and 
	backend to connect with each other. 
* Continue praticing my skills in front-end by trying out to recreate a navbar from a certain site. (1st) method involves display:block and manipulation
	of the padding property for the parent element and (2nd) the one i would recommend would be to use display:flex and gap along with it. Also,
	using 'justify-items:center' has no problem with flex with a good thing to note about. I'll dig deeper with the mobile view in the near future. 
	At this point, I'm thinking about creating a vlog about my coding journey. AT least, i'm getting more acquianted with what kind of display and 
	property best fits the job. Yeyyyy!!!...
* Well, I think today was a productive one. I finally deployed my first app with a backend on it at my site 'jmwebgo.com'. On the site, anyone can add 
	to the database. The backend is in javascript which is faster than python but more difficult to master but I'm getting there. Also, I noticed
	that my localhost has a tied to the firebase database which is convenient for me as a way to update the database alternatively. I also need to
	take note of the templates or phrases there are and there seems to be a lot of them. One thing I need to consider would be the whiteseed.live's
	response to multiple users when it finally gets live. I need to know more of the ip addresses setting it unique to others in order to avoid
	conflicts when one user is using the questionnaire. I think one way to handle this is through time or ip adresses or perhaps the uses of both.
* I got to admit, I've been a bit lacking in my efforts to apply for jobs. The '5 per day sending of applications' and the 'when in doubt, apply' concept
	isn't something that can be seen in me lately. I feel a bit tired actually right now. I'll do it this way: Apply to 5 jobs per day or spend one 
	hour applying whichever comes first. Lord, please help me land a good job where i can have a good work balance and that I may be able to go 
	attend church on sundays. Well, this really isn't part of coding but it's good to be able to see Mica to day by coincidence. It seems kinda 
	weird but okay...
	
August 31, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Practice my deploying skills with firebase to my site whiteseed.live. This time it went well. I figured I don't need to put a public folder
	in the src directory. Just 'cd ..' your way out into it if you are inside it or have just run 'npm start' and then proceed to the deployment
	process shortly after 'npm run build' and then use the updated build folder to replace the default public folder 'firebase init' will ask 
	you down the line.
* Work more with my navbar references and with css using float. It seems that display:block and float is the way to go.
* A lot can be put into entry today. First, let's start with the interview i was preparing myself into. It never went through. Apparently, I slept 
	through it or did I really? I'm not sure. I found out that the company jamiitech is a startup with few employees or that's what my perception is.
* Started learning about react and django. I haven't integrated with it firebase yet. I think I'm not there yet. Apparently, the video tutorial i was 
	following encountered a delay in my part. As i look in the API in the localhost:8000,.it indicates no 'POST' in there. This is something I need
	to resolve maybe by looking through more sample codes or tutorials. These are just some things I neeed to master; 'useState, useEffect, param,
	cors, axios, rest_framework (this seems to be the basic api framework), onChange among many other things. In the video tutorial, the use of 
	POSTMAN in testing out API can be seen. In my case, I use the thunder client in vscode. I doubt, using the postman will make any difference. I 
	need to since in the localhost:8000,.only the get, options and head are allowed. Also, I think i need to dig deeper with cors. I think the video 
	I just followed recently mentions somethign about 'npm run build' but i'm not sure if it has an impact to my predicament right now.
* Tried hosting a simple html file to 'whiteseed.live' and it worked. Now, it's time to revert it back. Now, in have the option to not use react as
	frontend. It was quite fast. My main problem now is hosting with the back-end involve.
* I'll need to find a way to simplify react bootstrap especially taking out the ReactBootStrap at the beginning of tags.
* Finally found the cullprit for the above predicament. '
* Tried 'notepad coding'. i had 2 errors. (1st) is that for embedded css which is usually placed in the <head></head>, the "... ..." is no longer needed.
	It is only applicable for inline css. (2nd) is that i had a ":" instead of ";" which is a minor inconvenience. On using the float property, the
	element itself must be 'display:block'. The parent element is optional as it can be 'display:block' or don't put at all. The 'margin' comes next
	to what seems to be significant. Note, that using 'display:flex' isn't recommended here at all.


August 30, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Follow-code with a todo app reference.
* Learned more about the properties of hyperlinks and the span tag which have an inline property I can manipulate with.

August 29, 2022 (Moday)

* Gonna try configuring samples here on github. Hosted one for now.
* Continue working on whiteseed.live
* on Django,. make migrations with a dedicated terminal running the server on the background and also, when rendering html files, it must be in 
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">
	<head>
	    <meta charset="UTF-8">
	    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

	</html>

August 28, 2022 (Sunday)

* Made an account with Figma for my deisgns in the future and current.

August 27, 2022 (Saturday)

* Finally got a working button for my django simple app. Also, I've been learning quite progressively with it.
* FIREBASE DEPLOY! I was wondering why my code didn't push through despote I'm done with 'firebase init'. It was quite silly of me.
* When configuring with the html files on the templates, i think it is best to modify the 'urls.py' next and then the 'views.py'.
* So far, my django references includes rendering html files. It may be good to have a counter, i think.

August 26,2022 (Friday)

* Consumed another 30 minutes of the Front-end interview video.
* Clone a django repository at github. Also, I'm having trouble opening my previous folder in django. I should practice putting the word 'main' in the 
	django folder with the settings.py in it for more clarity.

* Made a scheduled appointment for a video conference on August 31, 2022. 6:30am - 7:00am. Wish me luck.
* Prepare some interview technicalities for front end web development. Spent about 30 mins. with this video 
	"Frontend Interview Questions 2021 | Front End Developer Interview Questions And Answers |Simplilearn"
* Having trouble with react navbar. Their documentaion is questionable. React bootstrap feels like i want it to give the boots sometimes. 
	Found out that 	upgrading my react dom and bootstrap can lead to unwanted consequences.
* Worked on whiteseed.live on this local laptop. I made some pretty decent gains today. Thank You Lord! But, still I have a long way to go. The back-end
	still needs to be done for it. I'll do it with django. For now, it's time to push some codes to github.
* Update my git commands knowledge.
* Pushed whiteseed.live codes

August 23, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Did a video survey as emailed from onlinejobs.ph

August 22, 2022 (Monday)

* Continue to work on online portfolio.
* Found one solution for whitescreen react error.. <Router basename='/index.html'>

August 20, 2022 (Saturday)

* Make some notes about django.
* This install django in a virtual environment
	'pipenv install django'

This opens a file in vscode
	'code .'

This activates the virtual environment
	'pipenv shell'

This creates files in the current directory
'django-admin startproject storefront .'

This sets up our server. Try opening new terminal and type above if you are in trouble running server.
'python3 manage.py runserver'

Go to storefront directory and type. Note: everytime you make an app add it to settings.py INSTALLED_APPS list at the bottom. For this case, add in 'playground' with a comma at last.
'python manage.py startapp playground'

These sets "Hello World"
Go to playground and views.py and add

'from django.http import HttpResponse

def say_hello(request):
    #Pull data from db
    #transform data
    # return data
    return HttpResponse('Hello World')

Go to playground and add a new file named 'urls.py'

'from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
	path('hello/', views.say_hello)
]'

Go to storefront and urls.py. Add include function to line 17.
from:
	'from django.urls import path'
to:
	'from django.urls import path, include'
from:
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    ]

to:	
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('playground/',include('playground.urls'))
]

Note always end wit '/' forward slash on urls.

This gives an error to your homepages django. To counter this, remove 'include' as well as path.
	
=----------------------------------------
Html templates examples:

Go to playground, add new folder named 'templates' and add an html file. In this case, let's name it hello.html. with a content of
'<h1> Hello World </h1>'

Go to views.py and configure. The render function is use in this case and not the HttpResponse. 

'def say_hello(request):
    return render (request, 'hello.html')'
    
This is to use as new function.

For dictionary, use:

'{% if name    %}
<h1>Hello {{name}}</h1>
{% else    %}
<h1>Hello World</h1>
{%  endif   %}'

and

      'return render (request, 'hello.html', {'name':'Jmark'})'

August 19, 2022 (Thursday)

* Geez, where to start?
* Upwork - Collected some sample work entry level which is mostly mobile app development.
* Youtube - subscribe to Bro code and got an initial insight learning Java though at this point, my javascript skill is not that reliable still.
* Youtube - Watch some videos with Fireship on Flamethrower.js and about SEO (rule 1 and 2: create good contents, rule 3: render html that can 
  be utilize by bots: rule 4: Go fast).
* Uvocorp - Found a work worth $160 with a 14hours deadline. As much as I want to take it up, my java skills aren't really up to the task.
* Familiarize myself more with XAMPP.
* Add some codepen and html samples.
* Install html end tag label extension for vscode.
* Gotta learn Next.js framework. Been hearing it a lot from fireship.
* Instruction for git: react example
          Go to src directory and not outside and then push to github to avoid errors.
	  
                      git init
                      git remote add origin https://github.com/Jmarkzcod8r/Whiteseed.com.git
		      git remote set-url origin https://git-repo/new-repository.git		---> This changes the target repo
                      git commit -m "first commit"
		      git branch				---> Check which branch you are in and also available ones
		      git branch "new_branch"			---> Make new branch
		      git switch "branch-you-want-to-switch-to"	---> switch to specific branch
                      git checkout 				---> Younger brother of git branch
                      git push -u origin Main
		      git push --set-upstream origin "name-of-brach-you-want-to-push-your-codes-to"
            			Also, use firebase use --add
	    
* Got my 2nd website but this time with namecheap.com. I was finally able to costumize or in other terms push my react app in there. Whiteseed.live is 
  now live. Just like before, i tried manipulating by changing the name of the build folder into public folder but this time, I took some extra steps.
  The directory is pointed to src and the way to do it this apparently was to take out the firebase files in there and type 'npm run build'. The build
  folder will be created without influence from firebase. Now, put the firebase files back and also the build folder on which you will have to rename
  to 'build'. Once that is finish, you may now type 'firebase deploy'.
* Started learning about cloudflare and SSl. Firebase based on fireship provides free ssl. need to learn more about this more.
* Started learning about back-end with firebase. There are two types of databases with firebase accordingly, realtime and firestore. Firestore seemed to
  be the better one.
* My namecheap website isn't that secure compared to the one i bought with godaddy.com.
* Update: www.whiteseed.live is now secured but I have to learn more about web security with firebase.
* Silly me! I though my multipage app for my online portfolio didn't went through. They are at the bottom.

August 17, 2022 (Wednesday)

* After a thousand years, I finally was able to install and open wordpress and this time using xampp. It's quite basic comparet to actual coding with 
  html and css.
* Send my first proposal at Upwork. I need to gather more samples of work and prices in there just the way I am doing with Uvocorp. I think i sent in
* three proposals.

August 15, 2022 (Monday)

* Finished my second order with uvocorp. I think the task needs to be higher than the set pay but then again, I am just starting out.
* Convert red bubble uploader script to exe but won't upload images. Need to debug some more.
* Install auto-py-to-exe but output still won't load images.

August 14, 2022 (Sunday)

* Got a working LMC script for the assignment at uvocorp.

August 12, 2022 (Friday)

* Continue working on second order with Little man computer

August 08, 2022 (Monday)

* Troubleshoot code to run with my first costumer. He uses windows and pyCharm. I recommended using vscode and switching to linux.
* clone a github repo to cnvert python to c++ . Still haven't got it working yet.
* Continue working in my second order with boolean and little man computing.
* Took the test from those guys from Onlinejobs.ph. At least, I think I fared better than my last coding test. The test has something to do with object 
  oriented programming which is something I haven't fully mastered yet and also the sql lite was something I bombed at. Oh boy!

August 07, 2022 (Sunday)

* Took up another order from uvocorp. so far, so good.
* Just like before, using firebase to deploy my new app into my webpage is troublesome but I found that the best way to never overwrite the public folder
  or create a new one. This goes the same for index.html. It is best to run 'npm run build' and once you have your 'build' folder, change its name to
  'public'. Check also the index.html file if it is the one you want.
* Apparently, here us is the way I see it, I should  make a new branch whenever I would deploy my code to a website because it might be harder to edit
  the code after that.

August 06, 2022 (Saturday)

* Using my github static online portfolio seems to be better than using my website.

August 04, 2022 (Thursday)

* Finish my first order at uvocorp. I think it went great.

August 03, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Got my first order at uvocorp for an extra small task. I can do this. Wish me luck.

August 01, 2022 (Monday)

* Looked at uvocorp for some available coding work. It's overwhelming for now. There is such a thing as API, sockets and back-end stuffs going on
  that students need help. It's crazy actually.

July 31, 2022 (Sunday)

* Started to incorporate react-router-dom into my website. It turns out that it is best to create a folder of your routes inside the src file to
  avoid some conflicts along the way.
* Put some codepen outputs on some of my routes in my webpage source code and a particular pen is catchy because even though it doesn't use bootstrap,
  the variables works as a block using the scss description, html {....@supports(display: grid) {display: block;}
* By route sample 03, the javascript element uses a dollar sign '$'. By research, I found out it has something to do with jquery. okay.

July 30, 2022 (Saturday)

* Started learning to incorporate javascript to react.

July 27, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Finally resolve babel error with instructions after 'npm start'. Continue working on react bootstrap for portfolio. 

July 26, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Continue studying react bootstrap
* Git clone one of fireship.io's about discord  dashboard. Manage to be almost there.
* Started learning about tailwind.

July 25, 2022 (Monday)

* Started converting my online portfolio to bootstrap that can cater to a mobile app when viewing. Setting the width to a percentage for an image css
  seems to have done the trick. 

July 24, 2022 (Sunday)

* Spent about 2 hours with react bootstrap configuring a responsive navBar.

July 23, 2022 (Saturday)

* Continue reading documentation about javascript.

July 22. 2022 (Friday)

* Finish answering the python test sent by my potential part time job.
* Last night wasn't really that productive. My time was spent on a site involving relationships. I'll try to be more productive next time.

July 21, 2022 (Thursday)

* Still having a hard time installing mysql with bitnami due to the mariaDB error. It's kinda frustrating at this point. I had to revisit mySQL again 
  since I found an error invovling accessibility bus issue. Also, It's good to confirm that I can check whether mysql is running by just typing 
  "localhost:3306" in the browser and something like that.
* For the first time, I had my first coding test and you guessed it, I BOMBED at it. The pressure given was 30 mins. I knew I could do it if given 
  more time but later found out, there is a more efficient way to dealing with it than what I previously was doing. This would have been the code
  to go. I have known for a while that the "For" loop is good for list but I got to remember that the for-if-conitnue combination is good to set
  hierarchies of conditions. I'll try to remember that in a foor loop, there is like a hidden commented "continue"  Still, I'm grateful.

     def test():
        for x in range (1,101):
            # main condition
            if x%15==0:
                print("Sitehost")
                continue
            # secondary condition
            if x%5==0:
                print("Host")
                continue
            # tertiary condition
            if x%3==0:
                print("Site")
                continue
            # fourth condition
            if x%1==0:
                print(x)
            # continue
    test()


July 20, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Forked 8 repositories about ecommerce. I guess this is the way to for me for now as what Aaron Jack recommended.
* Tried to maneuver my way with one of the forked repositories. It involved new stuffs I have yet to fully familiarize myself with like Turborepo, 
  pnpm, storybook, cherry-pick and nvm. NVM stands for node version manager which is what you use for switching to different versions of nodes you 
  would use. PNPM is performant node package manager which is similar to yarn and npm. I had a bit of headached configuring how to switch versions with 
  pnpm. Also, it's good to put on the name of your package from time to time to read some documentation. The one that finally got me to switch from 
  different versions of pnpm would be "curl -f https://get.pnpm.io/v6.js | node - add --global pnpm@6". From here, it'll be easier to manipulate.
* Install MongoDB on laptop with user "Jmarkzcod8r" as admin. password is similar to 
. Download also the compass versino which serves as GUI but still
  haven't played around with it yet that much.
* Can't believe I didn't include about my bitnami wordpress installation that much last time. Apparently, I installed it for the third time. Was able to open it thru
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/ though I know there will be a lot to this in the future. After reading the documentation, clicking 'manager-linux-x64.run' is the
  way to go.

July 17, 2022 (Sunday)

* Revisited MySQL database. Gain more familiarity with the system because installing wordpress seems to require it.
* This is a mini documentation for mySQL:
    'mysql -u root -p' => access mysql at the root level. Change the 'root' for the username you want to use as you see fit.
    'mysql -u root -p <Data.Table> =>Logs into your mysql at the root level and selecting instantly the name of the table for immediate use. 
     mysql> USE menagerie => initializing the USE statement and then the name of the table by chich we are going to use or modify.
    'CREATE USER 'sammy'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';' => This creates a new username by the name of sammy with a password of 'password'.
    'GRANT PRIVILEGE ON database.table TO 'username'@'host';' => Grants privileges to a certain user. Change Privilege to either CREATE, ALTER, and DROP               databases, tables, and users, as well as the power to INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE data from any table on the server. It also grants the user               the ability to query data with SELECT, create foreign keys with the REFERENCES keyword, and perform FLUSH operations with the RELOAD.
    'GRANT CREATE, ALTER, DROP, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, REFERENCES, RELOAD on *.* TO 'sammy'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;' => Example
    'GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'sammy'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;' => Grants all privileges to user on all tables
    For more reference: Use https://do.co/3OiSNah
* Finally made a reference code for responsive navbar with react and bootstrap. In retrospect, I downloaded a zip file from github on it.

July 15, 2022 (Friday)

* Finally able to deploy my second attempt for a react app. Here is the order to remember: "sudo npm install -g firebase-tools","npm run build",
  "firebase init" (select hosting with optional update to github),"firebase deploy". Before this, I tried changing the package.json which didn't really
  helped much. Oh boy! If you find yourself not having an output, try deleting the build folder and running "npm run build" again to sort of restart
  your system.
* Finally able to deploy my online portfolio in my webpage "jmwebgo.com". At this point, I still have no idea why my initial build didn't go through.
  I'll save the figuring out to some other days. I copied the src file and pasted it to the directory that works and it went through in there.
  THANK YOU LORD!
* Started learning about react router to cater multiple pages for my react app. Followed some tutorial at youtube but when I tried it, it didn't go
  accordingly. Found out the code was outdated. I read the documentation for the new version and it worked. Still needs to explore more with the 
  router though.

July 14, 2022 (Thursday)

* Finally able to deploy a basic react app to my site using firebase. It was the primitive one with the spinning logo. 
* Practice some python challenges.
* Waiting for my online portfolio to be deployed if ever it is truly the case using firebase.
* Watch Fireship video on how he would make a website:
  Frontend: Javascript, ios, android, flutter                   Framework:  Typescript (catch bugs earlier), React (Most popular), React Native (Mobile)
  API: Stripe (payment), Apollo, GraphQL, (For complex APIs)                            Petite-vue, ionic
      Auth0 (Authentication), Aws rekognition,                  State Management: Redux, 
  Backend: Nodejs with NestJS, python (Flask, Django),          CSS Framework: Tailwinds, Sass, PostCSS, Bootstrap
            Firebase
  Database: mongodb, mySQL, noSQL                               Module Bundler: Webpack
            mySQL (gold standard)                               Web server: nginx, docker, terraform, 
            Redis (2nd database)                                Version Control: Github
  Note: Use script tags for APIs, Consider Bun for frontend.
* Revisit how to deploy react to github and push codes there. 
   1. Make a git repository thru the site github. Take note of the name.
   2. Add these to package.json... 
   
   "homepage": "https://Jmarkzcod8r.github.io/<Name_of_repository>", 
   "name": "<Name_of_repository>",
      
      "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "predeploy:": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    
   3. Use:  'npm install gh-pages' , 'git init', 'git add .', 'git add origin "https://Jmarkzcod8r.github.io/<Name_of_repository>", 
             'npm run build', 'npm run deploy', 'git push origin master'
July 13, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Continue familiarizing myself with firebase. I'm here in CBTL here in SM Gensan which is nice. The coffee is good as always. Cafe Mocha has been my 
  go-to cofee of choice for a while now. 
* Use basic_06_titleforme folder in react as test project in deploying a react app to my website using firebase. So, you may find yourself in a predicament
  due to this. Something to take note of in the future. I'm thinking of creating an app that will help commuters pair up when going to a particular 
  destination here in Gensan. I'll have to learn flutter and how to deploy your app in google play as well as make it available for different ios like
  android, apple and the likes. Still haven't decided yet.

July 12, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Watched a youtube video about godaddy by Craylor Made. He doesn't recommend it at all due to overpricing although the company has some good marketing
  and advertisement. He supports "Namecheap and Porkbun" more. Namecheap is good if you want domain, web and email hosting all in one roof. Porkbun
  delivers great value at some of the cheapest domain names in the industy. By ICANN regulation, you have to wait 60 days before you can transfer your domain
  from one registrar to another. 
* Learned wordpress is an open source tool used mainly by 45% of the websites. 

July 11, 2022 (Monday)

* Purchase a website named jmwebgo.com on godaddy.com. So far, I can see it is meant for basic to intermediate style of web development. It's good for
  easy site-on-the-go kind of stuff and showed it to some of my fellow workmates which made them appreciative.
* These are the stuffs that can be included in a navigation bar: "Home, Blogs, Products, Pricing, About Us, Contact Us, Resources, Promos, Careers, Login, 
  Explore, Tools, Messaging, Events, Review, Support, Demos, Solutions, Industries, Sale, Cart"

July 10, 2022 (Sunday)

* Finally enabled click-to-go-to-element part of my online portfolio by using id="" as the identifier.
* I need more tutorials and experience using git.
* Created a pull request for the new first contribution of new card I made.
* Started learning about how to convert your android tablet to be a second monitor. I think I need a cable for it.
* Thinking of making an app to calculate the distance from one location to another to help commuters on how much they should spend in fare.
* Started to look for software that can help me convert my tablet as a second monitor. So far, it isn't a fruitful one.

July 9, 2022 (Saturday)

* Applied to different job at glassdoor and also am e-mail from Toptal saying they paused my application for now which doesn't seem to be something 
  worth pondering about since I am skeptical of the site.
* Started learning about APIs.
* Started learning about bootstrap.
* Made a sample code for bootstrap.

July 8, 2022 (Friday)

* Write second CRUD reference with Pedro Tech
* Resolved first CRUD reference by opening different terminals for client and server. Run 'npm start' for App.js for client. And, run 'npm run devstart' 
  for server side to trigger operation of mysql.
* Apparently, there are more stuffs to install on the server side than the client one. These are some of them: "axios, body-parser, cors, express, mysql,
  nodemon". These can be seen in the package.json. Use 'npm init' to install package.json and click 'enter' all the way. For client side, use
  'npm install axios' to install axios which serves as the bridge to send and receive things from frontend and backend.
* Change repository of online log book from private to public again.

July 6, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Experimented with different inputs of html.
* Change repository of online log book from public to private
* Emailed GSC water district for inquiry about their web developer position. I'm starting to see some red flags on it. It turns out that it is a 
  position that has been vacant for quite some time now. Maybe the pay isn't that good and for a job order position, I may have have to decline
  on it if their repsonse doesn't suit me. It may not be worth it after all but still I won't have regrets sending that inquiry email.

July 5, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Continue to work on online portfolio by pushing codes to repository.
* Made accounts with glassdoor and onlinejobs.ph and applied for one in glassdorr.

July 4, 2022 (Monday)

* Add connect components to my online portfolio

July 1, 2022 (Friday)

* Finally solve the problem I have with the image attribute by installing Pillow 9.1.0 an older version.
* Added new components to my online portfolio.

June 29, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Added new component to my online portfolio. The qualifications box is now there.
* Finally got to be able to host a simple react site at github. It was a trial and I'm happy it finally showed itself.

June 27, 2022 (Monday)

* Added new components to my portfolio with logo of my languages and framework used.
* Watch a video of how to upload react project to github as well as host your portfolio there.

June 26, 2022 (Sunday)

* Added new features for my ongoing personal portfolio project. I'm using react and codepen to make this one and so far so good. I'm building it one step
  at a time. Or, in a similar phrase, one piece at a time. It's like I'm building a giant puzzle putting the components slowly and steadily. 
* Added an instruction manual to my Red bubble GUI uploader. I've used Tkinter, selenium, pillow and other modules for this one.
* Partial follow-code with Pedro Tech channel on using ReactJS, MySQL, NodeJS
* Install Mysql server on ubuntu 21.04 laptop with the command 'sudo mysql -u root -p' as the login.
* After how many hours I finally got the install mysql-workbench-community in ubuntu 21.04 laptop. Type 'mysql-workbench-community' to execute.
* Revisit auto-py-to-exe folder. Executing user interface can be done by locating run.py and typing 'python run.py' on command line.
* Conduct debugging for Ubuntu 21.04 linux for installing lightdm. Found out it is conflicting with the boot startup. Ended up de-installing.
* Continue mirror coding with Pedro Tech crud tutorial for reference.
