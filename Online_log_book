* Got my first order at uvocorp for an extra small task. I can do this. Wish me luck.

August 01, 2022 (Monday)

* Looked at uvocorp for some available coding work. It's overwhelming for now. There is such a thing as API, sockets and back-end stuffs going on
  that students need help. It's crazy actually.

July 31, 2022 (Sunday)

* Started to incorporate react-router-dom into my website. It turns out that it is best to create a folder of your routes inside the src file to
  avoid some conflicts along the way.
* Put some codepen outputs on some of my routes in my webpage source code and a particular pen is catchy because even though it doesn't use bootstrap,
  the variables works as a block using the scss description, html {....@supports(display: grid) {display: block;}
* By route sample 03, the javascript element uses a dollar sign '$'. By research, I found out it has something to do with jquery. okay.

July 30, 2022 (Saturday)

* Started learning to incorporate javascript to react.

July 27, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Finally resolve babel error with instructions after 'npm start'. Continue working on react bootstrap for portfolio. 

July 26, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Continue studying react bootstrap
* Git clone one of fireship.io's about discord  dashboard. Manage to be almost there.
* Started learning about tailwind.

July 25, 2022 (Monday)

* Started converting my online portfolio to bootstrap that can cater to a mobile app when viewing. Setting the width to a percentage for an image css
  seems to have done the trick. 

July 24, 2022 (Sunday)

* Spent about 2 hours with react bootstrap configuring a responsive navBar.

July 23, 2022 (Saturday)

* Continue reading documentation about javascript.

July 22. 2022 (Friday)

* Finish answering the python test sent by my potential part time job.
* Last night wasn't really that productive. My time was spent on a site involving relationships. I'll try to be more productive next time.

July 21, 2022 (Thursday)

* Still having a hard time installing mysql with bitnami due to the mariaDB error. It's kinda frustrating at this point. I had to revisit mySQL again 
  since I found an error invovling accessibility bus issue. Also, It's good to confirm that I can check whether mysql is running by just typing 
  "localhost:3306" in the browser and something like that.
* For the first time, I had my first coding test and you guessed it, I BOMBED at it. The pressure given was 30 mins. I knew I could do it if given 
  more time but later found out, there is a more efficient way to dealing with it than what I previously was doing. This would have been the code
  to go. I have known for a while that the "For" loop is good for list but I got to remember that the for-if-conitnue combination is good to set
  hierarchies of conditions. I'll try to remember that in a foor loop, there is like a hidden commented "continue"  Still, I'm grateful.

     def test():
        for x in range (1,101):
            # main condition
            if x%15==0:
                print("Sitehost")
                continue
            # secondary condition
            if x%5==0:
                print("Host")
                continue
            # tertiary condition
            if x%3==0:
                print("Site")
                continue
            # fourth condition
            if x%1==0:
                print(x)
            # continue
    test()

* Forked 8 repositories about ecommerce. I guess this is the way to for me for now as what Aaron Jack recommended.
* Tried to maneuver my way with one of the forked repositories. It involved new stuffs I have yet to fully familiarize myself with like Turborepo, 
  pnpm, storybook, cherry-pick and nvm. NVM stands for node version manager which is what you use for switching to different versions of nodes you 
  would use. PNPM is performant node package manager which is similar to yarn and npm. I had a bit of headached configuring how to switch versions with 
  pnpm. Also, it's good to put on the name of your package from time to time to read some documentation. The one that finally got me to switch from 
  different versions of pnpm would be "curl -f https://get.pnpm.io/v6.js | node - add --global pnpm@6". From here, it'll be easier to manipulate.
* Install MongoDB on laptop with user "Jmarkzcod8r" as admin. password is similar to 
. Download also the compass versino which serves as GUI but still
  haven't played around with it yet that much.
* Can't believe I didn't include about my bitnami wordpress installation that much last time. Apparently, I installed it for the third time. Was able to open it thru
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/ though I know there will be a lot to this in the future. After reading the documentation, clicking 'manager-linux-x64.run' is the
  way to go.

July 17, 2022 (Sunday)

* Revisited MySQL database. Gain more familiarity with the system because installing wordpress seems to require it.
* This is a mini documentation for mySQL:
    'mysql -u root -p' => access mysql at the root level. Change the 'root' for the username you want to use as you see fit.
    'mysql -u root -p <Data.Table> =>Logs into your mysql at the root level and selecting instantly the name of the table for immediate use. 
     mysql> USE menagerie => initializing the USE statement and then the name of the table by chich we are going to use or modify.
    'CREATE USER 'sammy'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';' => This creates a new username by the name of sammy with a password of 'password'.
    'GRANT PRIVILEGE ON database.table TO 'username'@'host';' => Grants privileges to a certain user. Change Privilege to either CREATE, ALTER, and DROP               databases, tables, and users, as well as the power to INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE data from any table on the server. It also grants the user               the ability to query data with SELECT, create foreign keys with the REFERENCES keyword, and perform FLUSH operations with the RELOAD.
    'GRANT CREATE, ALTER, DROP, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, REFERENCES, RELOAD on *.* TO 'sammy'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;' => Example
    'GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'sammy'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;' => Grants all privileges to user on all tables
    For more reference: Use https://do.co/3OiSNah
* Finally made a reference code for responsive navbar with react and bootstrap. In retrospect, I downloaded a zip file from github on it.

July 15, 2022 (Friday)

* Finally able to deploy my second attempt for a react app. Here is the order to remember: "sudo npm install -g firebase-tools","npm run build",
  "firebase init" (select hosting with optional update to github),"firebase deploy". Before this, I tried changing the package.json which didn't really
  helped much. Oh boy! If you find yourself not having an output, try deleting the build folder and running "npm run build" again to sort of restart
  your system.
* Finally able to deploy my online portfolio in my webpage "jmwebgo.com". At this point, I still have no idea why my initial build didn't go through.
  I'll save the figuring out to some other days. I copied the src file and pasted it to the directory that works and it went through in there.
  THANK YOU LORD!
* Started learning about react router to cater multiple pages for my react app. Followed some tutorial at youtube but when I tried it, it didn't go
  accordingly. Found out the code was outdated. I read the documentation for the new version and it worked. Still needs to explore more with the 
  router though.

July 14, 2022 (Thursday)

* Finally able to deploy a basic react app to my site using firebase. It was the primitive one with the spinning logo. 
* Practice some python challenges.
* Waiting for my online portfolio to be deployed if ever it is truly the case using firebase.
* Watch Fireship video on how he would make a website:
  Frontend: Javascript, ios, android, flutter                   Framework:  Typescript (catch bugs earlier), React (Most popular), React Native (Mobile)
  API: Stripe (payment), Apollo, GraphQL, (For complex APIs)                            Petite-vue, ionic
      Auth0 (Authentication), Aws rekognition,                  State Management: Redux, 
  Backend: Nodejs with NestJS, python (Flask, Django),          CSS Framework: Tailwinds, Sass, PostCSS, Bootstrap
            Firebase
  Database: mongodb, mySQL, noSQL                               Module Bundler: Webpack
            mySQL (gold standard)                               Web server: nginx, docker, terraform, 
            Redis (2nd database)                                Version Control: Github
  Note: Use script tags for APIs, Consider Bun for frontend.
* Revisit how to deploy react to github and push codes there. 
   1. Make a git repository thru the site github. Take note of the name.
   2. Add these to package.json... 
   
   "homepage": "https://Jmarkzcod8r.github.io/<Name_of_repository>", 
   "name": "<Name_of_repository>",
      
      "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "predeploy:": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    
   3. Use:  'npm install gh-pages' , 'git init', 'git add .', 'git add origin "https://Jmarkzcod8r.github.io/<Name_of_repository>", 
             'npm run build', 'npm run deploy', 'git push origin master'
July 13, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Continue familiarizing myself with firebase. I'm here in CBTL here in SM Gensan which is nice. The coffee is good as always. Cafe Mocha has been my 
  go-to cofee of choice for a while now. 
* Use basic_06_titleforme folder in react as test project in deploying a react app to my website using firebase. So, you may find yourself in a predicament
  due to this. Something to take note of in the future. I'm thinking of creating an app that will help commuters pair up when going to a particular 
  destination here in Gensan. I'll have to learn flutter and how to deploy your app in google play as well as make it available for different ios like
  android, apple and the likes. Still haven't decided yet.

July 12, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Watched a youtube video about godaddy by Craylor Made. He doesn't recommend it at all due to overpricing although the company has some good marketing
  and advertisement. He supports "Namecheap and Porkbun" more. Namecheap is good if you want domain, web and email hosting all in one roof. Porkbun
  delivers great value at some of the cheapest domain names in the industy. By ICANN regulation, you have to wait 60 days before you can transfer your domain
  from one registrar to another. 
* Learned wordpress is an open source tool used mainly by 45% of the websites. 

July 11, 2022 (Monday)

* Purchase a website named jmwebgo.com on godaddy.com. So far, I can see it is meant for basic to intermediate style of web development. It's good for
  easy site-on-the-go kind of stuff and showed it to some of my fellow workmates which made them appreciative.
* These are the stuffs that can be included in a navigation bar: "Home, Blogs, Products, Pricing, About Us, Contact Us, Resources, Promos, Careers, Login, 
  Explore, Tools, Messaging, Events, Review, Support, Demos, Solutions, Industries, Sale, Cart"

July 10, 2022 (Sunday)

* Finally enabled click-to-go-to-element part of my online portfolio by using id="" as the identifier.
* I need more tutorials and experience using git.
* Created a pull request for the new first contribution of new card I made.
* Started learning about how to convert your android tablet to be a second monitor. I think I need a cable for it.
* Thinking of making an app to calculate the distance from one location to another to help commuters on how much they should spend in fare.
* Started to look for software that can help me convert my tablet as a second monitor. So far, it isn't a fruitful one.

July 9, 2022 (Saturday)

* Applied to different job at glassdoor and also am e-mail from Toptal saying they paused my application for now which doesn't seem to be something 
  worth pondering about since I am skeptical of the site.
* Started learning about APIs.
* Started learning about bootstrap.
* Made a sample code for bootstrap.

July 8, 2022 (Friday)

* Write second CRUD reference with Pedro Tech
* Resolved first CRUD reference by opening different terminals for client and server. Run 'npm start' for App.js for client. And, run 'npm run devstart' 
  for server side to trigger operation of mysql.
* Apparently, there are more stuffs to install on the server side than the client one. These are some of them: "axios, body-parser, cors, express, mysql,
  nodemon". These can be seen in the package.json. Use 'npm init' to install package.json and click 'enter' all the way. For client side, use
  'npm install axios' to install axios which serves as the bridge to send and receive things from frontend and backend.
* Change repository of online log book from private to public again.

July 6, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Experimented with different inputs of html.
* Change repository of online log book from public to private
* Emailed GSC water district for inquiry about their web developer position. I'm starting to see some red flags on it. It turns out that it is a 
  position that has been vacant for quite some time now. Maybe the pay isn't that good and for a job order position, I may have have to decline
  on it if their repsonse doesn't suit me. It may not be worth it after all but still I won't have regrets sending that inquiry email.

July 5, 2022 (Tuesday)

* Continue to work on online portfolio by pushing codes to repository.
* Made accounts with glassdoor and onlinejobs.ph and applied for one in glassdorr.

July 4, 2022 (Monday)

* Add connect components to my online portfolio

July 1, 2022 (Friday)

* Finally solve the problem I have with the image attribute by installing Pillow 9.1.0 an older version.
* Added new components to my online portfolio.

June 29, 2022 (Wednesday)

* Added new component to my online portfolio. The qualifications box is now there.
* Finally got to be able to host a simple react site at github. It was a trial and I'm happy it finally showed itself.

June 27, 2022 (Monday)

* Added new components to my portfolio with logo of my languages and framework used.
* Watch a video of how to upload react project to github as well as host your portfolio there.

June 26, 2022 (Sunday)

* Added new features for my ongoing personal portfolio project. I'm using react and codepen to make this one and so far so good. I'm building it one step
  at a time. Or, in a similar phrase, one piece at a time. It's like I'm building a giant puzzle putting the components slowly and steadily. 
* Added an instruction manual to my Red bubble GUI uploader. I've used Tkinter, selenium, pillow and other modules for this one.
* Partial follow-code with Pedro Tech channel on using ReactJS, MySQL, NodeJS
* Install Mysql server on ubuntu 21.04 laptop with the command 'sudo mysql -u root -p' as the login.
* After how many hours I finally got the install mysql-workbench-community in ubuntu 21.04 laptop. Type 'mysql-workbench-community' to execute.
* Revisit auto-py-to-exe folder. Executing user interface can be done by locating run.py and typing 'python run.py' on command line.
* Conduct debugging for Ubuntu 21.04 linux for installing lightdm. Found out it is conflicting with the boot startup. Ended up de-installing.
* Continue mirror coding with Pedro Tech crud tutorial for reference.
