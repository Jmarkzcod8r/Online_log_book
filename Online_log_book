* Added new features for my ongoing personal portfolio project. I'm using react and codepen to make this one and so far so good. I'm building it one step
  at a time. Or, in a similar phrase, one piece at a time. It's like I'm building a giant puzzle putting the components slowly and steadily. 
* Added an instruction manual to my Red bubble GUI uploader. I've used Tkinter, selenium, pillow and other modules for this one.
* Partial follow-code with Pedro Tech channel on using ReactJS, MySQL, NodeJS
* Install Mysql server on ubuntu 21.04 laptop with the command 'sudo mysql -u root -p' as the login.
* After how many hours I finally got the install mysql-workbench-community in ubuntu 21.04 laptop. Type 'mysql-workbench-community' to execute.
* Revisit auto-py-to-exe folder. Executing user interface can be done by locating run.py and typing 'python run.py' on command line.
* Conduct debugging for Ubuntu 21.04 linux for installing lightdm. Found out it is conflicting with the boot startup. Ended up de-installing.
* Continue mirror coding with Pedro Tech crud tutorial for reference.
